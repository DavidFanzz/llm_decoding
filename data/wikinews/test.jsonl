This will cause the planet's appearance to peak at a brightness and size not seen since then. The planet Uranus will also make a close approach, but will be more difficult to spot, as it is much farther away.\nScientists say that Jupiter will rise at about the time of sunset and will be nearly directly overhead at midnight. The only brighter object that will be in the sky at that time will be the moon. NASA scientist Tony Phillips said \"Jupiter is so bright right now, you don't need a sky map to find it.\" It will not appear this bright again until 2022.\nJupiter will pass within 368 million miles of Earth at the time of closest approach. Although this will occur on Monday and Tuesday, it will remain large and bright for approximately another month.\nDuring this event, the planet will be located in the sky not far from the moon. Some of the planet's own moons will be visible with the aid of a telescope or binoculars.\nAccording to NASA scientists, Earth-Jupiter encounters occur about every 13 months. Since both planets' orbits are slightly elliptical, meaning they are not perfect circles around the Sun, the distance varies in each encounter.\nJupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System, is the fifth planet from the Sun and is more massive than all of the other planets combined, about 318 times as massive as the Earth."}

Her refusal to abort the pregnancy is cited as the motive behind the killing.  Samudio has been missing since June 4th.

Martin, of Native American ethnicity, was 27 years old when she died of unknown causes, said investigators.\nMartin, who had been dating the 46-year-old Busch for \"the last several months\" according to friends, was a native of Springfield. She had previously been married to 45-year-old doctor Kevin J. Martin until February 2009, when they divorced, and had joint custody of their eight-year-old son. Adrienne Martin had a profile on iStudio, a modeling website, where she said she wanted to become an art therapist. She also expressed a desire to \"to do beer advertising\" and work in the modeling industry. At the time of her death, Martin had been working toward a master's degree in art therapy.\nThe memorial service for Martin was held at South Haven Baptist Church in Springfield. Busch was not among the estimated 100 people attending the service, nor was he mentioned during it. The only speaker was the church's pastor, Scott Watson, who read letters from Martin's friends. Her son and other relatives sat in the front row while she was remembered as a gifted artist and dedicated mother. Lacy Elet, one of Martin's friends, later said Martin was happy that \"her life was finally in order.\" Her obituary in the Springfield News-Leader called Busch \"the love of her life.\" However, one of Martin's uncles, Andy Eby, said after the service, \"There are too many questions and not enough answers.\"\nMartin was found unconscious by Michael Jung, who worked at Busch's mansion, at 12:30 p.m. local time (18:30 UTC) on December 19. At 1:12 p.m., Jung called emergency services, saying, \"This girl's just not waking up.\" When asked if she was breathing, Jung responded with, \"We don't know. It's dark back there. I'm gonna get a light and try and see.\" At 1:26 p.m., Martin was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency workers. Law enforcement officials said the room was dark because there were blackout \"curtains drawn in the bedroom.\"\nAn autopsy on Martin's body did not find any trauma-related injuries, and the official cause of death has not been established by investigators. A toxicology report, expected to take several weeks, will likely be used to determine the reason Martin died. Police said Martin's body did not exhibit any \"apparent signs of trauma or other indications of cause of death.\" According to her ex-husband, Adrienne Martin had a rare heart condition, called Long QT syndrome, which can cause palpitations and sudden cardiac death. Kevin Martin said his ex-wife never sought medical advice on her condition and did not talk about it with friends.\nPolice said that Busch was home at the US$2 million mansion when Martin was discovered, and that the ongoing investigation is being handled by the Frontenac Police Department and the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's Office. Art Margulis, a lawyer for August Busch IV, said Martin was visiting the Huntleigh residence and that there is \"absolutely nothing suspicious\" surrounding her death."}

Their paper is published today in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\nThe group studied twenty years of records of global weather conditions and wind speeds. They say that beneath the ozone hole, wind speeds are increased, which whips up more sea spray. Salt from this is carried upwards and makes the clouds brighter, reflecting more of the Sun's radiation. This helps cool the Earth, counteracting the effects of global warming.\nThe ozone layer in the atmosphere protects life from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, and the discovery of its rapid depletion in the 1980s caused widespread alarm. The Montreal Protocol adopted in 1987 forced countries to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the man-made chemicals thought to be largely responsible for the hole.\nProfessor Ken Carslaw, of the University of Leeds School of Earth and Environment, was one of the co-authors of the paper. He warned that as the ozone hole healed, warming in parts of the Southern Hemisphere could accelerate. \n\"If, as seems likely, these winds die down, rising CO2 emissions could then cause the warming of the southern hemisphere to accelerate, which would have an impact on future climate predictions,\" he said\nDescribing the findings as \"unexpected and complex climate feedback\", Professor Carslaw emphasised that this research was not a reason to try and keep the hole open:\n\"You can't correct two wrongs in that way. The ozone hole was potentially a major catastrophe for the planet that was only stopped by the Montreal Protocol, so we can't go back on that.\"\nHe said instead that carbon emissions should be cut drastically.\nThe research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence Programme.\nJudith Perlwitz, a resercher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that the group's data were sound but she disagreed with some of the paper's conclusions. Perlwitz claimed that rising temperatures due to global warming would increase wind speeds anyway, leading to the same effects as the ozone hole.\nThe question is whether the wind is really going to slow down, and that I doubt, she said.\nAccording to a World Meteorological Organization report in 2006, it is likely to be at least fifty years before the ozone above Antarctica is back to its pre-1980 state."}

Abraham has been chief executive of UKTV, an organisation owned between BBC Worldwide and Virgin Media Television, since April 2007. He was also famous for creating the marketing slogan for the television channel Dave: \"Everybody knows a bloke called Dave.\" As well as this, David was previously the general manager and president of The Learning Channel, which is currently owned by Discovery Communications. \nAbraham was given the appointment as chief executive of Channel 4 after the previous chief executive of the channel, Andy Duncan, departed from his position in November 2009. At around the same time that David Abraham becomes chief executive of the channel, Luke Johnson's time on the channel is due to come to an end, after it was reported in November 2009 that Lord Terence Burns was confirmed to take over his position as chairman of Channel 4. When Abraham was appointed, both Burns and Johnson were part of the interview panel.\n\"David is a rare commodity as a broadcaster in that he has an exceptional track record as an innovative leader, both creatively and commercially,\" Lord Burns noted about Abraham. \"At all stages of his career he's led creative teams and commissioned creative output of the highest quality in a commercial environment. It is that experience, we believe, that so well qualifies him for the challenge of running a commercially-funded, public service broadcaster like Channel 4.\"\nDavid Abraham commented: \"I look forward to leading the whole organisation through its next period of growth and innovation, both creatively and commercially. What I bring...is idealism, versatility and a record of leading creative organisations through change.\""}

His comments included assurances that America was not abandoning space exploration, contrary to claims he was doing so after he announced the US's budget for 2011, which would have ended most of NASA's current projects, including the development of new heavy-launch rockets called the Constellation Program.\nUnder Obama's latest program, NASA would receive US $6 billion as supplementary funding over the next five years to develop new projects, which Obama emphasized, saying NASA was in the unusual position of having an expanded budget while other government agencies must comply to financial restrictions or cuts in efforts to reduce the US public debt. With the additional funding, NASA would extend the life of the International Space Station (ISS) by four years further, to at least 2020, design a new series of heavy-lift rockets by 2015, and continue development of the Orion crew capsule, a major part of the Constellation program.  Initially, the capsule would serve only as a rescue vehicle for the ISS, but would later serve as the \"technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions.\" The proposed project would also retain plans for private operators to service the ISS, despite criticism that such operators were not reliable enough for the task.\nThe centerpiece of the plan would be manned missions to the moon and beyond, beginning with missions to asteroids around 2025, with missions to Mars following within a decade. Initially, Mars missions would consist of sending humans to orbit Mars, with missions to land on the surface of the planet coming shortly after. Obama said that under the plan, \"we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do.\"\nObama said that under his new plan, NASA would be able to achieve more in a shorter amount of time than it would have under the Constellation Program.  He also said that, contrary to fears that changes in NASA would result in job losses in Florida, where most space missions are launched from, under his new plan, a total of 2,500 jobs would be created in the area.\nThe new plan would, according to Obama, lead to \"major breakthroughs\" in the US space program.  He said that the goal of the new program would  be \"no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite.\"  The president also emphasized the need for continued innovation, saying that \"weve got to do it [space exploration] in a smart way and we cant just keep on doing the same old things weve been doing and thinking thats going to get us where we want to go.\""}

The unprecedented vaccination drive will last for a week.\nThis is the first time the World Health Organization has launched such an event across multiple regions at once. WHO officials say their goal is to expand immunization coverage and raise awareness of the importance of vaccines, and that such cross-border activities can prevent disease and save lives.\nWHO spokesman Daniel Epstein says that many countries are working to eliminate measles, adding that says countries in the European region are very concerned that they have stalled in their goal of eliminating measles and rubella this year.\n\"In European countries, in many of them, immunization coverage is below the 95 percent recommended level. And, there have been ongoing measles outbreaks in some of these countries. Measles cases have also been imported to the US and Canada and the Americas from European countries,\" said Epstein.\nThe agency says an important goal of the immunization campaigns is to reach those who have been excluded up to now. It notes that every year, in the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 25 percent of deaths among children under age five are attributed to vaccine preventable diseases. 2.1 million children in the Middle East hadn't received a shot against tetanus, whooping cough, or diphteria in 2009, according to the WHO.\nIn the Americas, WHO says special regional events are being held in border areas of Nicaragua, between Suriname and French Guiana, and between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It says many young children, pregnant women, elderly and indigenous peoples live in isolated areas where vaccine coverage is low.\nIn all three regions, Epstein said the vaccination campaigns will be accompanied by health information campaigns.\n\"The biggest obstacle to reaching our goals of vaccination are lack of awareness, lack of information and people being ignorant that they should be vaccinated, and thus not having enough vaccinators, money, trucks, bicycles, etc. to get to these remote regions,\" he said.\nWHO also began a large polio immunization campaign across sixteen countries in central and West Africa on Saturday. It says 78 million children under five will be vaccinated to stop a major outbreak of the disease."}

Detroit, once one of the top five U.S. cities in population, has its lowest number of residents since 1910.\nPopulation numbers affect the amount of federal and state funding a city receives. In the last few decades, dozens of Michigan state laws have been passed allowing Detroit, because its population was at least 750,000, special measures to raise revenue and  allocating it a larger share of Michigan's state revenue than its population warranted. Now that Detroit's population has fallen to 713,777, it is no longer eligible for these financial advantages.\nThe mayor of Detroit, Dave Bing plans to appeal the census results. He says more than 35,000 residents were not counted.\n\"Every person thats counted in the census brings approximately $10,000 to Detroit over the next decade for schools, roads, hospitals, and social service programs,\" Bing explained. \"Additionally, we could lose millions in statutory revenue sharing from the state. We are in a fiscal crisis and we have to fight for every dollar. We cant afford to let these results stand.\"\nDetroit was  the fifth largest U.S. city in 1950. The decline of the auto industry hastened the population loss already diminished by the 1967 riots that precipitated white flight to the suburbs. Approximately 23 percent of the citys living quarters are now empty. To reduce the city's size there is a program in progress to demolish 10,000 abandoned or vacant buildings and turn the land into farms or countryside by 2014.\nDetroit's congressional power has been steadily decreasing. It already lost one congressional seat since the 1980s.\nU.S. federal laws forbid drawing congressional district boundaries that dilute minority voting strength. The 2000 redistricting rules for the 2012 elections mandated that Detroit's two  congressional districts must be 60 percent black voters, since four out of five of Detroit's residents are black. To comply, the two remaining congressional districts will have to expand into Detroit's mostly  white suburbs to attain enough minority voters to meet the 60 percent target, reducing the clout of black Detroit.\nAndrew Beveridge, Queens College sociology professor, attributed Detroit's population decline to the loss of its industrial base. He said: \"Except for New Orleans after Katrina, it's basically the largest drop for a U.S. city in history. They have to find an economic base or the decline will continue.\""}

On Sunday, his condition was described as \"serious\".\nByrd was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952 and to the U.S. Senate in 1958. He suffered from ill health in recent years but retained his reputation for securing millions in federal funding for his home state.\nThroughout his career in the U.S Senate he held positions including Senate Majority Whip, Majority Leader twice and Minority Leader once. Due to his status as the longest serving Senator, Byrd was serving as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, which made him third in line in the Presidential line of succession. Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii has been sworn in as the new President pro tempore.\nByrd served nine terms in the Senate and was labeled by critics as the \"King of Pork\".

He considered himself a staunch defender of United States Constitution, and carried a copy of it in his pocket. Byrd was versed in parliamentary procedure using some of the Senate's arcane rules to his advantage. He received awards from the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians for significant contributions to history.\nByrd had his share of controversy.

Byrd was involved in the filibuster against the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which he voted against. Byrd later explicitly and repeatedly denounced his former segregationist views.\nByrd is the only Senator to have voted against the nominations of African-American Supreme Court justices Thurgood Marshall and Marshall's successor following his retirement, Clarence Thomas. Byrd's opposition of Thomas was based on the testimony of Anita Hill who accused Thomas of sexually harassing her and due to the fact that Byrd felt Thomas was \"injecting racism\" into the debate by using the phrase \"high-tech lynching of uppity blacks\" in his defense against the allegations.\nByrd, who supported the Vietnam War, was one of the most outspoken critics of the War in Iraq. He voted against the Iraq War Resolution. Byrd spoke on the eve the invasion saying, \"Today I weep for my country. [...] No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed. Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned.

The vote was 6947, just two votes short of the 71-vote supermajority needed to propose constitutional amendments for ratification by voters in the next election cycle.\nIn the redistricting process, the boundaries of legislative districts are redrawn every ten years following the US census. Districts are redrawn such that they contain constituencies roughly equal in population. During the last three redistricting periods, however, discussions have resulted in deadlock such that the maps were essentially chosen by lottery. Democrats, Republicans, and regular citizens alike have all unsuccessfully attempted to reform that process this year. All constitutional amendments must be proposed by Monday in order to be voted on in a referendum during the election next November.\nThe Democratic bill,Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 121, was sponsored by State SenatorKwame Raoul and State RepresentativeBarbara Flynn Currie, both from Chicago. The representatives voted mostly on party lines: Democrats hold 70 seats in the House, and 69 of them voted for the amendment. 46 Republicans and one Democrat voted against it. Currie presented the amendment as an improvement because it \"gets rid of the tiebreaker.\" In fact, she argues that the public benefits from giving the job of redistricting to the legislature as a whole, rather than an appointed committee. \"...leaving the decision in the hands of 177 people who are elected by the geographic diversity...is more democratic than giving it instead to the hands of four legislative leaders.\"\nCurrie was referring to the Fair Map Amendment, a citizen-led proposal to create a nine-member commission that would contain no legislators. The party leaders would select eight of the members, however, which Democrats have opposed as intoducing too much bias. Others are against the amendment on the grounds that it does not adequately ensure minority representation.\nThe lone Democratic dissenter, Representative Jack Franks from Marengo, disagrees. \"I couldnt get past that because I want to have a system where its not legislators choosing their electors, it should be the electors choosing the legislators,\" he said. Even Illinois Governor Pat Quinn was not enthusiastic about the bill and thought it was not \"true reform\".\nRepublicans have introduced the citizen-initiated Fair Map Amendment in the legislature as an alternative and have pushed for its passage.The bill was quickly struck down by a Democrat-led committee. At the same time, organizers of the petition drive for the Fair Map Amendment announced that they fell short of the nearly 300,000 signatures needed to bypass the legislature and directly place the question on the ballot."}

The Haaretz newspaper says there were five deaths.\nReports say such massive protests have never been seen in the country before; they come two weeks after Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was overthrown by a popular revolt. Egyptian protestors, apparently inspired by the fall of Ben Ali, are demanding that Mubarak resign, complaining about unemployment, poverty, repression, and other issues.\nOver five hundred protestors were arrested during the skirmishes.

The official death toll stands at 617, while 9,980 more were injured and an additional 313 reported as missing. The Chinese ministry of civil affairs reports that 15,000 houses had collapsed and 100,000 people - almost the entire population in the area - remain without homes.\nThe plateau where the earthquake hit is frequently visited by tremors; however, there are rarely many casualties due to its remoteness and small population. However, in May 2008 a heavy 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Sichuan foothills, killing 80,000 people.\nRescue efforts are underway, but impeded due to the area's remoteness and landslides, which have blocked many roads in the area. Also a factor is the high altitude at which the area is located - about 4,000 metres above sea level (13,000 feet) - which could adversely affect rescue crews not used to being in such thin air. Sniffer dogs, for instance, who aren't accustomed to working at high sea levels, could have a harder time detecting living people buried beneath rubble.\nPower and telephone lines were also downed by the temblor, affecting communication, although the authorities commented that electricity and phone links have been repaired to tens of towns.\nChina's state media reports that troops garrisoned in the Yushu county, with help from locals, have already rescued over a thousand people buried beneath debris.\nResidents and troops garrisoned in the Yushu county have managed to pull out more than 1,000 people alive, according to Chinese state media. They are using shovels and bare hands.\nFurther exacerbating the situation is the weather: temperatures are freezing, and meteorologists predict sleet and wind to come within the next few days. Many people were forced to sleep outdoors, protecting themselves from the cold in blankets, or spending the night in vehicles.\nPierre Deve for the non-governmental organisation Snowland Service Group, was present in Yushu. He described the damage to Times Online, saying: \"There are corpses everywhere on the street. They dont have time to deal with them. There is a real need for medicine, for food, for water and for doctors. People are terrified that there will be another earthquake. They are also afraid that a dam that has been cracked will burst and flood the town.\"\nA local doctor, Karma Sherab, also commented on the problems the area is facing: \"Most of the hospitals have collapsed and others had become dangerous. The only thing we can do is to clean the wounds in a simple way or simply amputate instead of curing.\"\nChinese president Hu Jintao, meanwhile, said that he would be dispatching over 5,000 rescuers and soldiers to the scene of the disaster; the government has pledged over US$29 million worth of aid. Hu described the quake as being a \"huge calamity\". He is also shortening his visit to a summit in Brazil to return to his country. \"That is why I decided to bring forward my return to China,\" he said from Brasilia.\nPremier Wen Jiabao has visited Yushu to oversee relief work; he decided to delay a visit to southeastern Asia due to the disaster. \"As long as there is the slightest hope, we will make efforts that are 100-fold. Your disaster is our disaster, your suffering is our suffering.\"\nThe head of China's disaster relief department, Zou Ming, says that 120,000 articles of clothing, 120,000 quilts, food, and close to 40,000 tents were to be sent to the disaster zone; he encouraged people to donate money to assist in longer-term relief work.\nMeanwhile, some foreign countries have offered financial help; among them is Japan, which has pledged over one million dollars to disaster victims.

The state senator from Wrentham beat Massachusetts's Attorney General, Martha Coakley, in a closely watched race that many believe may have a nationwide impact.\nWith higher than expected turnout  despite snow and rain blanketing much of the state  Brown won with 51.9% of the vote, as Coakley lagged behind closely with 47.1% of the vote in a state generally considered to be heavily Democratic.  The race garnered national attention when Brown came from behind in opinion polls to take a last-minute lead, leaving Democrats scrambling.  Meanwhile, Independent Libertarian Joseph L. Kennedy, who has no relation to the late Senator Kennedy, ran under the Liberty ticket on the ballot and only garnered one percent of the vote with 22,237 votes.\nSecretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin predicted earlier in the day that turnout would be 40 to 55 percent. Galvin was quote as saying, Weve been in touch with many of our city and town clerks to monitor turnout. They uniformly tell us that turnout is brisk, that interest is strong.\nGalvin added, Were particularly seeing a high level of interest in some of the suburban communities. Traditionally cities tend to vote somewhat later. But we have seen a number of communities (with) lines, and people standing in lines, very patiently, in the snow. His office sent out 105,000 absentee ballots.\nBrown's strongest vote came from the suburbs of Boston where independent voters, which make up a majority in Massachusetts, generally live. \nCoakley's strongest vote came from the cities, including the capital, Boston, where she won by a large margin, along with Massachusetts' second and third largest cities, Worcester and Springfield.  Other large cities that went for Coakley included New Bedford, Fall River, Brockton, Lynn, Salem, and Lawrence.\nWikinews reporter Patrick Mannion noted the turnout at his polling place in Lynn was small to moderate.\nBrown has promised to be the 41st Republican senator that will end the Democrats' filibuster proof supermajority and in a ironic twist of fate possibly end health-care reform of which his predecessor Ted Kennedy called \"the cause of my life.\" \nCoakley called Brown shortly before the election was called for him to concede to him. She then went in front of supporters at Boston's Sheraton Hotel saying, \"Although our campaign ends tonight, we know that our mission continues and our work goes on.\" Coakley continued, \"I am heartbroken at the result and I know that you are also, but I know that you will get up together and continue this fight even with this result tonight.\"\nCoakley finished her speech with a slight crack in her voice by quoting Ted Kennedy's famous line from the 1980 Democratic National Convention, \"The work begins anew, the hope rises again, and the dream lives on.\"\nMeanwhile, at Boston's Park Plaza Hotel, Brown gave his victory speech to supporters saying, \"Ill bet they can hear all this cheering down in Washington, D.C.\" Brown continued, saying, \"And I hope theyre paying close attention, because tonight the independent voice of Massachusetts has spoken.\"\nBrown added, \"This Senate seat belongs to no one person and no political party  and as I have said before, and you said loud and clear today, it is the peoples seat.\"  He continued, \"The people, by their votes, have now filled the office themselves, and I am ready to go to Washington without delay.\"\nBrown was joined on stage by his wife, Gail Huff, a reporter for local television station WCVB-TV, and his two daughters Arianna and Ayla Brown.  Ayla was previously a contestant on the reality singing show American Idol.  Brown said, \"I rely as always, on Gail's love and support and that of our beautiful daughters.\" \nBrown jokingly added, \"And just in case anyone who's watching throughout the country they're both available. No, no. No. Only kidding, only kidding. Only kidding, only kidding. Arianna... Arianna's, definitely not available. But Ayla is. This is Arianna. This is Ayla. I can see I'm going to get in trouble when I get home.\"\nBrown closed by saying, \"Im Scott Brown. I'm from Wrentham. I drive a truck, and I am nobodys senator but yours.\"\nPresident Barack Obama phoned both candidates Tuesday night, congratulating Brown on a well-run campaign and saying he is eager to work with him on the urgent problems facing Massachusetts voters and all Americans.\nCoakley noted the President's call in her concession speech saying, He actually just called me before I came onstage to say that we cant win them all, and he knows that better than any, as he told me. But he appreciates what I did and what you did, and he said to extend his heartfelt thanks to everyone who worked on the campaign.\nBrown's response to the President's call was, \"Would you like me to drive the truck down to Washington so you can see it?\"  Brown was referring to his 2005 GMC Canyon pickup truck which became an icon of his campaign, which featured in commericals portraying him as an everyday, regular joe Massachusetts citizen.  The pickup truck was mocked by President Obama when he made a campaign stop on Sunday to drum up support for the lagging Coakley.\nThis led Brown to quip, \"I didn't mind when President Obama came here and criticized me  that happens in campaigns.  But when he criticized my truck, that's where I draw the line.\"\nSenator-elect Brown will fill the remaining two years of Ted Kennedy's term. Brown will replace Senator Paul Kirk, a longtime friend of Ted Kennedy who was holding the seat in the interim until the special election was concluded. \nThe last time Massachusetts elected a Republican was in 1972 when they re-elected Edward Brooke, the state's first African-American senator, to a second term.  Brooke first ran in 1966 and was elected then. \nHowever, the seat that Ted Kennedy held, which is the Class 1 seat, was held by a Republican until 1952 when Henry Cabot Lodge lost his re-election bid to Ted's older brother, John F. Kennedy, who would later become the 35th President of the United States.  Ted Kennedy won the seat in a special election in 1962 against Lodge's son, George C. Lodge.  Kennedy held the seat for 46 years until dying of brain cancer in August 2009.\nMany local politicans spoke about the victory, Mayor of Boston Tom Menino who recently began his fifth term earlier this month said, I never thought Id see the day when a Republican replaces Ted Kennedy. I think Scott Brown caught the wave of anger thats out there, and the wave of anti-Obama.\"\nRepresentative Ed Markey, the Democrat who represents Massachusetts's 7th congressional district, plans to pass the health care bill despite the victory.  Markey said, \"As Sen. Kennedy would say, the cause endures, and the dream will never die.\nRepresentative Barney Frank, the Democrat who represents Massachusetts's 4th congressional district, was blunt on Coakley's loss.  \"Martha Coakley was a lousy candidate.  She let herself get involved in a personality debate.\"\nCoakley was blamed by some Democratic officials for running a bad campaign and not campaigning enough for the seat, especially with taking a vacation right before the new year to the Caribbean.\nMassachusetts Senate President Therese Murray said, \"Money was the issue after the primary. We just couldn't get people's attention.\" \nFormer Republican Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, who back in 1994 took on the late Senator Kennedy for this same seat in a heated election, was quoted as saying, \"When it comes to the liberal arrogance in Washington, D.C. Scott Brown's victory is the shot heard around the world.\" \nRomney added, \"Hes run a good campaign and hes made it clear that the ignorance in Washington has been rejected.\" Romney was also quoted saying, \"This is really a referendum, if you will, on the Barack Obama agenda...I think the people here in Massachusetts, in the bluest of blue states, are saying they dont like this kind of arrogance.\"\nPoliticians from around the country also chimed in such as Howard Dean, the former Governor of Vermont, a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and the former head of the Democratic National Committee, who was responsible for the \"50 States\" strategy which focused on winning Democratic seats in all 50 states.\nDean speaking on MSNBC said, \"Weve got to be tougher. Ive said Democrats havent been tough enough.\" He added, \"I dont think this was a backlash on health care reform, I think it was a backlash on Washington.\"\nSenator Robert Menendez, Democrat from New Jersey, who is the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said, \"I have no interest in sugar coating what happened in Massachusetts.  There is a lot of anxiety in the country right now.  Americans are understandably impatient.

This proposal was met with strong opposition from export-based economies such as Japan, whose Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda argued that specific targets were \"unrealistic\", but approved of unspecific \"guidelines\". He added: \"There are many perspectives on the current account issue. Every country has a different situation when it comes to surpluses and deficits.

In April, the technology blog Gizmodo obtained a prototype of the new phone and published details of it online. While introducing iPhone 4, at the annual conference, Jobs started by hinting at the incident, saying, \"Stop me if you've already seen this.\"\nThe new iPhone was praised by Jobs as \"the biggest leap we've taken since the original iPhone.\" It is only 9.3 millimetres (0.37 inches) thick, making it \"the thinnest smartphone on the planet\", a 24 percent reduction from Apple's previous model, the iPhone 3GS. Structure-wise, iPhone 4 has a new stainless steel frame, which acts as an antenna, supposedly boosting its signal reception abilities and possibly reducing the amount of dropped calls. It also has a new screen, dubbed a \"retina display,\" which displays images at 326 pixels per inch. During the keynote, Jobs demoed the device's new internal gyroscope as well. Even though it now uses Apple's faster A4 processor (first used in its iPad tablet), iPhone 4 has a claimed seven hours of 3G talk time, up two hours from the 3GS.\nIn addition to its design features, Jobs showed off iPhone 4's new video calling abilities. This feature is called FaceTime, and connects with other iPhone 4s via Wi-Fi. The phone has two cameras: one on the front for video chats, and one on the back for taking pictures and other videos. The rear camera has a resolution of five megapixels, is capable of recording high-definition video, and has an LED flash.\nThe iPhone 4 will use Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 4. Formerly \"iPhone OS,\" iOS 4 was first introduced by Apple in April, and includes multitasking capabilities. Jobs called the new software \"the most advanced mobile operating system in the world.\" iOS will support Apple's new mobile advertising service, iAd, which goes live on July 1.\niPhone 4 will be available on June 24 in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. It comes in two colorsblack and whiteand two storage capacities. The 16GB version is priced at US$199 and the 32GB version at US$299. The iPhone 3GS's price will be reduced to US$99, and the iPhone 3G will be discontinued. iOS will be available as a free software update to users of compatible older Apple devices (including the 3GS) on June 21. In the U.S., iPhone 4 will only be available on AT&T's cellular network, despite calls for Apple to let the iPhone be used on other carriers, such as Verizon.\nCompetition-wise, the BlackBerry mobile device is still the most popular smartphone right now. Apple is also facing some serious competition from web giant Google's Android operating system, as well as Palm's webOS. Earlier this year, Android phones managed to outsell iPhones. iPhone users, however, account for over half of those surfing the Internet on a mobile browser in the U.S. Jobs also noted that over five billion iOS applications, commonly called \"apps,\" have been purchased from Apple's App Store. The App Store currently has around 225,000 different apps for sale."}

The device, constructed from silicon, absorbs light and dissipates the energy as heat.\nProfessor Hui Cao's researchers were following on from theoretical work last year by Professor Douglas Stone. Stone explained \"we were working on a theory that could predict what could be used to form a laser,\" and the theory also predicted the possibility of an anti-laser. Lasers amplify light to produce coherent pulses.\nThe new anti-laser focuses two identical laser beams towards each other. The light is trapped in an optical cavity and bounces until all the energy is converted into heat. The one constructed by Yale used a piece of silicon 110 micrometers wide; it absorbed 99.4% of light at a wavelength of 998.5 nanometers, which is close to infrared.\nStone felt \"[t]heory and experiment matched very well. We couldn't have expected to do any better.\" The theory suggests that 99.999% could be absorbed, but Yale blamed \"experimental limitations\" for not achieving this. Yale explained that more sophisticated anti-lasers may approach this absorption rate, and added that simulations suggest much smaller versions could be made.\nThe research team believes it could have applications in supercomputing, with machines using light and not electrons like regular computers. Many computer components are already manufactured from silicon. Since the energy is dissipated as heat, however, use is limited against laser weapons since the heat would damage the target anyway.\nGeneral light-absorption is not difficult, according to Stone, but this is the first time a device has been built targeted to the specific-wavelength beams produced by lasers."}

As of last Friday, organizers have collected only 120,000 of the 279,000 votes needed to bypass the state legislature and have the issue decided on solely by the voters in the November 2 election.\nThe current process of redistricting, or redrawing district lines every ten years following the nationwide census, is in the hands of the state legislature, or the General Assembly. The maps are often drawn by party leaders, allowing incumbent legislators to minimize and discourage opposition in their districts and perpetuate the leading party's dominance statewide.\nElection statistics indicate that incumbents are successful in their reelection 98 percent of the time, and that Democrats have dominated legislative elections since they were able to draw the redistricting map in 2001.The Democratic Party has successfully reinforced their dominance through \"spoking\", which involves extending districts in Chicago  a Democratic stronghold  out into the more Republican-leaning suburbs. In addition to allowing more Chicago residents to become legislators, this method severely weakens the strong Republican presence in the suburbs. Republicans, if given the chance to draw the maps, could overturn this trend by keeping key Republican-leaning suburban and downstate communities intact within their districts.\nThe Fair Map Amendment, supported by Republicans and good-government groups such as the League of Women Voters of Illinois, would take the redistricting process out of legislators' hands and instead give that task to an independent, nine-member commission. The amendment would apply to the redistricting of only state legislative districts, not US congressional districts. The General Assembly would still have to approve the commission's suggested map, however.\nProponents initially aimed to collect the required signatures by April 1, but their inability to do so forced them to push their deadline to last Friday. Even then, organizers were still unable to meet their goal, and they now have until May 3 to send the necessary paperwork to the Illinois Secretary of State's office. \"We're not having so much trouble; it's two weeks before we have to file,\" saysJan Czarnik, a member of the League of Women Voters.\nCzarnik suggests that the petition low number of signatures is due in part to not having \"enough people circulating petitions in such a short amount of time.\" As Kent Redfield of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of IllinoisSpringfield commented, \"If you've got basically volunteers circulating petitions rather than, say, political parties, people that are normally used to doing this, you're going to have to have a larger margin of error.\" Another possible setback is that public opinion may not carry as much fervor as for other previously proposed amendments.\nRepublicans, who hold the minority in the legislature, have proposed the amendment through more conventional means  via the General Assembly  but have been unsuccessful. Legislators also have considered other ways to reform the redistricting process. A few Republican party leaders' campaign funds have donated cash to the group organizing the petition, and House Minority Leader Tom Cross has asked the governor to call a special session on legislative redistricting. Some Democrats support the amendment, including Sheila Simon, her party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor.\nOther Democrats, however, strongly oppose the proposal. SenatorMartin Sandoval from Chicago warns that \"Hispanics will not see a proportionate and fair increase in Hispanic-majority districts,\" and the Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund wants assurances that minority rights will not be curtailed."}

Dr Patel had concluded that the death of Sally White in 2002, the first victim of Anthony Hardy (the so-called \"Camden Ripper\"), could have been from natural causes.\nThe report produced by Dr Patel concluded that Sally White had been having consensual sex in her apartment when she died of a heart attack, in spite of blood stains on her clothing, blood at the scene, damage to Ms White's liver and bite marks. The GMC panel found that Dr Patel had included inaccurate information on his CV and had shown \"deficient professional performance\" in the evaluation of the cause of Sally White's death. They concluded that this investigation was \"irresponsible, not of the standard expected of a competent forensic pathologist and liable to bring the medical profession into disrepute\". Dr Patel is currently suspended and the decision of the panel may lead to him being struck off.\nThe GMC had previously investigated Dr Patel and criticised his investigation of the death of Ian Tomlinson, a newspaper seller who died during the G20 protests in London. He concluded that the death was caused by coronary heart disease; subsequent investigations by other pathologists showed that he had died from internal bleeding caused by a blunt force trauma  an assault by a police officer caught on video. The Director of Public Prosecution noted afterwards that the mistakes in the forensic pathology report by Dr Patel had made it significantly harder to bring the police officer who fatally assaulted Ian Tomlinson to justice. Dr Patel has also been investigated by the GMC for alleged misconduct in the investigation of the deaths of two children."}

The value of the prize breaks the record for the largest amount of money won in a lottery in the United Kingdom. The previous record, which was approximately 45 million (US$70.5 million, 52 million), was claimed in November 2009. That amount was given to both of the two lottery ticket winners of the draw, both of which happened to live in the United Kingdom.\nThe 56 million win, which occurred as a result of the EuroMillions lottery draw on Friday, was actually a share of the jackpot total of approximately 113 million (US$177 million, 130 million). The prize was shared between the UK winner and another winning ticket holder in Spain. At present, neither of the two winners have been publicly identified. \nA spokesperson for the Camelot Group, who runs the EuroMillions lottery in the United Kingdom, said: \"We have got the champagne ready and we're just waiting for the lucky winner to come forward. It's the biggest win that we have ever had in this country and whoever it is, wherever they are, their life is about to change dramatically. Subject to validation, the prize could be paid out when the banks open on Monday.\"\nThe EuroMillions lottery draw takes place in nine European countries including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland.

It was decided by the army to begin anew after a \"red team\" recommended that the army either upgrade the existing ground vehicle fleet or rewrite the requirements. Program officials choose to end evaluations of vehicle submissions and to begin again in two months with new requirements.\nThe previous design requirements emphasized modularity, affordability, rapid design and low risk technology. The infantry fighting vehicle variant would have carried a crew of three and nine infantry dismounts. It was initially to be compatible with the current Battle Command Control and Communications Suite but would gradually use a more revolutionary network. The system would support networking between external systems, vehicles and soldiers. It was to be transportable by C-17 cargo aircraft, rail, and ship and be as logistically deployable as the Stryker. The army officials were open to tracked or wheeled submissions but suggested that it be tracked due to the weight stemming from the requirements. The vehicle had an off-road speed requirement of 30 mph (50 km\/h) and was required to deliver improved maintainability and consume less fuel than the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. The army wanted the vehicle to leverage an autocannon, a anti-tank guided missile system and non-lethal weapons. The army wanted the vehicle to have the blast protection level equal to the MRAP and supplement armor with active protection systems.\nThe army wanted the first vehicle variant to be a troop carrier that would displace the aging M113 APCs and M2 Bradleys. Later, other variants of the GCV would appear.\nThere were four known competing contractors for the Ground Combat Vehicle contract. BAE Systems led a team consisting of Northrop Grumman, QinetiQ, and Saft Group. BAE offered a tracked vehicle with a hybrid-electric engine, a baseline weight of 53 tons and a maximum weight tolerance of 75 tons for modular armor and various countermeasures including a V-hull and active protection systems. General Dynamics led a team consisting of Lockheed Martin, Detroit Diesel, and Raytheon. General Dynamics offered a vehicle using diesel and leveraging an active protection system. SAIC led a consortium called Team Full Spectrum which included Boeing, Krauss-Maffei, and Rheinmetall. SAIC offered a vehicle based on the Puma. Advanced Defense Vehicle Systems (ADVS) submitted its proposal for a wheeled vehicle but was rejected for being non-compliant.\nThe predecessor to the GCV, the Manned Ground Vehicle family, was canceled in April 2009. Similar programs like the M8 light tank and XM2001 Crusader have also been scrapped in the past. The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, and Ground Combat Vehicle programs have been targeted for cancellation by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform."}

Immediately after boarding the vessel, Bethune was detained by the Japanese crew and held on board the ship for a month before it returned to Japan, where he was arrested by a waiting Coast Guard delegation and placed into custody in Tokyo.\nThe arrest has generated great publicity in Japan, where public opinion is generally in favor of whaling, and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is consistently criticized. Japan's whaling program, which the government says is a part of Japanese culture, results in the killings of around a thousand whales annually in hunts that the government claims are for scientific research. Activist groups such as Sea Shepherd, however, say that the program is a cover for commercial whaling, banned worldwide in 1986.\nA member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Paul Watson, captain of another anti-whaling vessel, said that he thought the arrest of Bethune would provide greater support for their actions. He said that although the group has not been in contact with Bethune, he expected that his actions would make him an \"international hero\", particularly in his home country of New Zealand."}

New York's Michael Werner Gallery confirmed the cause of death as complications with multiple sclerosis, a condition Van Vliet suffered from for many years.\nBorn in Glendale, California on January 15, 1941, the highly experimental musician created several unique and influential albums from 1967 through to 1982, backed by a frequently changing group of musicians known as The Magic Band. His most famous album, Trout Mask Replica (1969) melded free jazz, blues-rock, and avant-garde styles to create a critically acclaimed (albeit commercially unsuccessful) work. He retired from music in 1982 to focus on painting.\nWhilst none of the albums released by Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band, including 1967 debut album Safe as Milk, were commercially successful, his work is regularly cited as highly influential. Groups such as The Sex Pistols, Jethro Tull, Hawkwind, and Roxy Music all mention Beefheart as influencing their music.\nA childhood friend of Frank Zappa, Beefheart was christened Don Glen Viet, later changing this; and, adopting the stage name of Captain Beefheart at Zappa's suggestion.

Dizaei, who was branded a \"criminal in uniform\" by Independent Police Complaints Commission chair Nick Hardwick, has been jailed for four years after he attempted to frame an Iraqi businessman.\nIt took a Southwark Crown Court jury under three hours to find Dizaei guilty of misconduct in a public office and attempting to pervert the course of justice. The charges carried a maximum of life imprisonment.\nDizaei, 47, who is head of the National Black Police Association, had gone to the Yas Persian restaurant, run by one of his friends, and taken his wife Shy with him. They then went to their car and struck up a conversation through its open window with the restaurant's manager. During this conversation they were approached by Waad al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi website designer in his twenties. He requested that Dizaei pay 600 that he owed Baghdadi, who had constructed his website.\nAccording to the Crown, this dispute had been ongoing for months and Dizaei had been attempting to intimidate Baghdadi. He told the Iraqi to depart when he entered the restaurant; although the businessman did, he stayed nearby and rang the 999 emergency number.\nThe exact content of the argument that led up to this is unclear. Dizaei and his wife testified that Baghdadi was abusive and threatening, telling the officer he would \"extract the money out of your throat\" while the owner of the Yas said he was \"a crook basically... His history ... everybody knows he's not a good gentleman,\" said owner Sohrab Eshragi. Eshragi said that the request Baghdadi leave the premises was due to concerns of trouble, claiming Baghdadi had been in a previous fight. Baghdadi denied the allegations and the court rejected Dizaei's version of events.\nWhile Baghdadi was making his emergency call, Dizaei arrested him and made a 999 call of his own. He requested assistence from other officers, and said that Baghdadi had assaulted him by stabbing his stomach with a shisha pipe. He maintained this account when police arrived and kept it up in written statements, but although Baghdadi was found to be carrying such a pipe examination of Dizaei's wounds by a police doctor concluded he had inflicted them upon himself. \nA Home Office pathologist questioned this finding for the defence. Dr. Nat Cary said it was based on a \"fundamentally flawed approach,\" and that the injuries were consistent with Dizaei's version of events. He has helped investigate the assassination of former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto, and the death newspaper seller Ian Thomlinson, the latter of whom died during a G20 protest.\nThe Crown further alleged that Dizaei told Baghdadi \"I'll fuck your life... You think I don't know what you do in London... I'll find every single detail of your life in London.\" The prosecution case was presented by Peter Wright QC, who has prosecuted in trials over serial murders of Suffolk sex workers and a plot to bomb transatlantic airliners. He said that Dizaei's actions were a \"wholesale abuse of power by a senior police officer for entirely personal and oblique motives.\"\nJudge Justice Simon said that Dizaei had committed a \"grave breach of public trust\" and told him \"This sentence needs to send a clear message that police officers of whatever rank are not above the law.\" A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said outside the court that \"He abused his power and ignored his responsibility,\" and that while corruption was unacceptable in any police officer it was particularly so in a senior member of the forces. \"The public should have confidence that we will prosecute anyone, regardless of their position, if they commit serious offences. We believe justice has been served for the victim and the public.\" \n\"[I]f he [Dizaei] had been successful, Mr al-Baghdadi may have been sent to prison,\" noted Hardwick. \"Mr al-Baghdadi has shown tremendous strength of character throughout this case  from the moment he was confronted by Ali Dizaei, throughout our investigation, and finally when giving evidence at court. We are grateful for the confidence he placed in the IPCC and, as a result of that, justice has been done today.\"\nDizaei has been a policeman for 24 years, and at one stage was rumoured to be destined to take control of the Metropolitan Police, although the Metropolitan Police Authority may now choose to end this career. His trial, which began this month, is his second this decade. He was prosecuted in 2003 but cleared of any wrongdoing. The incident with Baghdadi was in June 2008 and Dizaei has been suspended on full pay since September of that year. Hardwick said that \"The greatest threat to the reputation of the police service is criminals in uniform like Dizaei.\""}

The Times has also reported claims that former detainees have joined al-Qaeda on returning to Yemen.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) claimed U.S. authorities had cleared the release of about 35 Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo.

But, it says continuing to hold Yemenis at Guantanamo without charge \"only increases resentment against the United States and hands al-Qaida a recruiting tool.\"\nThe Center for Constitutional Rights called the decision \"unconscionable\". \"We know from the military's own records that most of the detainees at Guantanamo have no link to terrorism,\" the group said.\nMitch McConnell, Republican Party minority leader in the U.S. Senate, backed the move. \"Given the determined nature of the threat from al-Qaeda, it made little sense to transfer detainees from the secure facility at Guantanamo back to Yemen, where previously transferred detainees have escaped from prison and returned to al-Qaeda,\" he said.\nPresident Obama reiterated his pledge to shut down the Guantanamo prison, saying its existence helps al-Qaeda to recruit members and damages U.S. national security interests.

Dr Alina Rodriguez, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College, London, and a team of researchers from various European universities studied nearly 8,000 children from the north of Finland; 87 of these were ambidextrous (mixed-handed).  Parents, teachers and the children themselves assessed language skills, academic achievement and behaviour.  At ages 7 and 8, the ambidextrous children had double the rate of language problems and were twice as likely to have problems at school.  At age 15 and 16, the proportion of those with ADHD symptoms was twice as many in the ambidextrous group, and their ADHD symptoms tended to be worse.  Ambidextrous children in the study also had a higher rate of language problems.\nThe number of people who are ambidextrous is unclear, with estimates ranging from 1% to 5%. Scientists do not know why some people use both hands when the majority of people prefer to use one predominantly. The theory is that there is something different in the brains of ambidextrous people, although Rodriguez says that more work in the area is needed. \nA person who prefers using their right hand will have a more dominant left hemisphere of the brain, which is the part of the brain for language skills. Rodriguez and her researchers have suggested that the right hemisphere of the brain of an ambidextrous child is weaker compared to that of a right-handed child, increasing their susceptible to problems with attention.  Previous suggestions about the causes of ADHD include the possibility that a person's right hemisphere has weaker function. Earlier studies have drawn links between dyslexia and being ambidextrous, and other studies are looking at the part that differences between the two sides of the brain play in language skills and psychosis.\nRodriguez emphasised that the research, published in the journal Pediatrics in the United States, did not show that all ambidextrous children would have such problems, pointing out that most of the children in the survey did not develop them.  \"Our study suggests that handedness is really a marker for atypical foetal brain development  showing that the brain is working in a different way to the norm\", she said, adding that other studies have shown atypical brain development to be associated with extraordinary creativeness. She also suggested that the results may assist schools and health care workers in targeting children at risk of problems. "}

At that time, an MRI showed \"a reduction in brain size associated with cells dying from metabolic stress.\" He stopped breathing in October and was hospitalized at  Ontario's London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) where he remained until Sunday. A panel of  five pediatric clinic and three neurology physicians subsequently concluded that \"there will be no recovery and no treatment options exist for this progressive neurodegenerative disorder.\"\nThe infant's parents, Moe Maraachli and Sana Nader, wanted Joseph to receive a tracheotomy, which combined with  mechanical breathing devices, would allow him to  be transferred home,  his family acting as care givers. Several years previously,  the Maraachli's  daughter had  died of a similar neuro-degenerative condition. They used their daughter, Zina, as an example. After doctors performed a tracheotomy on her, she returned home for several months before returning to die at the hospital.

Adis Medunjanin and Zarein Ahmedzay are being held by FBI agents pending charges, and are expected to appear before a Brooklyn judge Friday.  The arrests seem to be in connection with the investigation of Najibullah Zazi, who was also arrested in September on charges of trying to attack the subway system.  When Zazi was arrested in September, investigators said they knew the identities of at least three of his associates, but they did not release information about them.\nThe New York Times reports the two men and Zazi, who are all in their 20s, attended the same high school in the New York City area. Prosecutors have accused Zazi of conspiring to use homemade bombs against unspecified targets in the United States.  Law enforcement officials have said the plot may have involved New York City's mass transit system.\nThey allege Zazi spent more than a year plotting the attack with co-conspirators and that he received bomb-making instructions in Pakistan in 2008. The U.S. government also says he bought components to build improvised explosive devices and traveled to New York City on September 10, 2009, to move forward with his plans. Zazi's father was also arrested in September and charged with lying to federal officials."}

Officials from the United Nations have said that they fear that the disease will spread across the entire country. As the cholera spreads quickly across the country anxiety levels are high as fears mount that the disease will spread to the earthquake ravaged city of Port-au-Prince. However, so far only a few cases have been reported in the capital which occurred when five people from the Artibonite region traveled to the capital where the disease became symptomatic.\nA field hospital has been setup in Saint-Marc to help treat patients while Oxfam has sent specialists to set up sanitation, hygiene and water facilities. The Health minister, Alex Larsen, and the president, Rene Preval, toured the affected areas and Larsen revealed that the government was launching a large anti-cholera campaign, aided by the WHO and US health officials. The UN has set up cholera treatment facilities in the Artibonite region and sent additional doctors. Facilities were also set up in the capital. It is believed that the massive surge of deaths will soon subside, but there will be more cases in the future due to the disease being established in the atmosphere. \nAccording to the CDC cholera is \"an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.\" The CDC also says, \"the infection is often mild or without symptoms, but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 20 (5%) infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.\" Cholera is contracted from drinking water or eating food contaminated by the Vibrio cholerae bacteria."}

Over half a billion cell phones are active in India, but only 366 million people there have access to a toilet.\n\"It is a tragic irony to think that in India, a country now wealthy enough that roughly half of the people own phones, about half cannot afford the basic necessity and dignity of a toilet,\" commented Zafar Adeel, Director of United Nations University's Institute for Water, Environment and Health (IWEH).\nIndia's 545 million cell phones serve about 45 per cent of the population of more than one billion. Only 31 per cent (366 million) have access to modern hygienic amenities as of 2008. The United Nations University (UNU) recommends achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) which aims to cut in half the number of people lacking safe water and proper sanitary arrangements. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), there would be a deficit of one billion people from that target aimed for 2015. \n\"Anyone who shirks the topic as repugnant, minimises it as undignified, or considers unworthy those in need should let others take over for the sake of 1.5 million children and countless others killed each year by contaminated water and unhealthy sanitation,\" Adeel added. \n\"Popular education about the health dangers of poor sanitation is also needed. But this simple measure could do more to save lives, especially those of young people, improve health and help pull India and other countries in similar circumstances out of poverty than any alternative investment. It can also serve as a very significant boost to the local economy,\" he said. \"The world can expect, however, a return of between $3 and $34 for every dollar spent on sanitation, realized through reduced poverty and health costs and higher productivity  an economic and humanitarian opportunity of historic proportions.\"\nThe nine recommendations made by the UNU include changing the MDG target from 50 per cent by 2015 to 100 per cent coverage by 2025. Another suggested reform was to assign 0.002 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to improving sanitation. Approximately 358 billion dollars would be required to achieve that MDG target, considering that a toilet costs 300 dollars."}

He says that, since the landfill came into existence, there have been 141 instances of planes hitting birds while flying near the airport and 21 instances at the airfield during takeoff and landing operations. Bird strikes are a common problem in aviation that can lead to equipment damage and human casualties.\nIt has been reported that, for a long time, airport administration and groups of local citizens concerned with the landfill have been appealing to different Moscow Oblast and Russian Federation authorities to address the problem, but almost nothing has been done to close the landfill due to obstacles in local governing and commerical systems. It has been emphasized that the existence of the landfill in question is not officially permitted, and as such, the landfill is operating illegally.\nAs reported by Navalny, the only thing state authorities could recently accomplish, was a temporary suspension of trash transportation during May 712, when many world leaders came to Moscow through Sheremetyevohistorically the state's main civil airportto celebrate Russia's 65th Victory Day.

Regardless of the increase, China still spends significantly less on its military as a proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP) than other countries around the world.  China spends about 1.4% of its GDP on the military, while the United States spends about 4% of its GDP on the military.  The US, which accounts for 48% of the world's military spending, has frequently encouraged China to be more transparent about its military spending, a challenge which China said it was meeting.\nAt a press conference, Mr. Li said that the increase was in response to various security threats to China, although the nature of the threats were not specified.  He did, however, say that, \"The only purpose of China's limited military strength is to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"  He also said that the government has limited military spending to the best of its ability, and had tried to ensure a balance between the military and other needs.\nAccording to US military analysis and official Chinese reports, China has been steadily increasing military spending since the late 1980s, when the country began a program of improving its entire armed forces, including developing and producing weapons and equipment. The US Pentagon issued a report in 2009, saying that military spending had increased by an average of 12.9% annually since 1996. Based on this, analysts say that the earlier large spending increases could explain the slower increase for 2010. China in the past few years has seen dramatic spending increases in other sectors, especially costs related to the global financial crisis, and these sectors have complained about the amount of military spending.  As one analyst, David Shambaugh from George Washington University, put it, \"There have been complaints from some other sectors that it has been distorting expenditures. Maybe some of those arguments have come home to roost.\""}

His testimony comes only a day after former foreign office legal advisor Michael Wood told the inquiry that his own advice, that a further resolution was required, was ignored in favour of Goldsmith's. Goldsmith's account was under scrutiny because he had consistently said that it would be \"safer\" if a further resolution were obtainedsince it would have put the \"matter beyond doubt and nobody could have challenged the legality\"before changing his mind and giving the \"green light\" only a month before the invasion. He said that he had \"good reasons\" for \"ultimately reach[ing] a different view\", and called his previous advice \"too cautious\". He based his support of the war's legality on a series of UN resolutions dating back to the end of the Gulf War.\nUntil February 2002, he believed that a new resolution would be required, but he said today thatafter discussions with US and UK diplomatshe realised that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 \"revive[d]\" the authority of the United Kingdom to use force, as outlined in previous resolutions. One of these was United Nations Security Council Resolution 678, which was passed in November 1990. It authorized \"Member States co-operating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area\" against Iraq if Saddam Hussein failed to give up his weapons of mass destruction. However, there has been debate about whether \"all means necessary\" included military force.\nHe admitted that he had told then prime minister Tony Blair, as far back as 2002, that any justification for war other than a UN resolution (such as regime change or self defence) would be invalid. Goldsmith said, \"I don't think it [the advice] was terribly welcome.\" However, he added, \"The prime minister made it clear that he accepted that it was for me to reach a judgement and he had to accept it.\" Goldsmith agreed that he ignored the advice of other legal advisors, including Michael Wood (who spoke before the inquiry yesterday) and Elizabeth Wilmshurst (who resigned in protest days before the invasion), who both said that invading Iraq without a new UN resolution would amount to the \"crime of aggression\". Goldsmith claimed to have \"paid great attention to what their views were,\" but added, \"Ultimately I disagreed with the views they took.\"\nHe said that an \"unequivocal\" opinion was needed before the invasion, and that this was what he gave in March, having been unsure about the war's legality previously. He denied changing his mind only days before the invasion, as some have claimed, saying that he had advised the government that the war would be legal as far back as February, and that his advice was \"consistent\". He also called claims that he was pressured into changing his opinion \"nonsense\". He said that he \"was ready to answer questions\" and intended to debate the issue with the cabinet, but was told that they would read his advice before moving on to different issues. He said that the debate did not in fact take place  he told the inquiry that he believes cabinet ministers considered it to be \"a slightly sterile exercise\".\nIn his testimony, Goldsmith also criticised Jack Straw's response to Wood's advice, saying that, while ministers could \"challenge\" legal advice, Straw \"appeared to be rebuking a senior legal adviser for expressing his own legal view\" in a recently declassified letter. He was also concerned that the cabinet ignored, or was unaware of, the caveats included in his March advice on the war's legality, in which he said that \"the safest legal course\" would be to get a new resolution, despite a \"reasonable case\" being available based on existing resolutions. His advice warned the government that he was not \"confident\" that the case based on existing resolutions would stand up in court. Goldsmith also requested the declassification of documents relating to the war's legal status, which are available to the Iraq inquiry, but not to the public. Sir John Chilcot, the chair of the inquiry, said that Goldsmith's \"frustration is shared.\""}

The storm is headed towards Bermuda and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida expect it to strengthen over the next two days.  Hurricane Danielle is the second hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.\nNorth America is simultaneously threatened by Tropical Storm Frank.  The 80 km\/h (50 mph) storm in the Pacific Ocean is about 210 km (130 miles) south-south west of Acapulco, Mexico. Mexico has issued a tropical storm watch in the area.\nHurricane Danielle formed near the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa, being classified as Tropical Depression Six. It then developed into a more organized cyclone.\nMeteorologists predict that Danielle will be the first of several storms to form within the next two weeks, as the Atlantic hurricane season is currently at its peak. \"There are signs that the Atlantic is acting like it should in August and September. We're seeing more activity than we did earlier in the season,\" said Rick Knabb of the Weather Channel.\nEven though the 2010 season seems to be one with low activity, emergency officials are still stressing safety and awareness to residents in hurricane-prone areas. \"It only takes one storm to cause a loss of lives and devastating property damage,\" Lauren McKeague, Florida Division of Emergency Management, says. Hurricane Andrew was a catastrophic Category 5 storm that came during a year when it was a lower-than-average season."}

Ross currently presents his own chat show, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, as well as presenting his own programme and The Film programme on BBC Radio 2. He has decided to leave the corporation when his contract ends in July 2010. The contract was reported to have a value of 18,000,000 over the space of three years, however this has not been confirmed by the BBC.\nRoss, who has been working with the BBC since 1996, spoke to news reporters outside his house.  \"It's probably not a bad time for me to move on  and it's probably not a bad time for the BBC, either,\" he stated.  \"I've got six months left, I'm hoping to make the best shows of my career with them.\"  This information emerges one day after the announcement came that another BBC talk show host, Graham Norton, had signed a deal for two years with the BBC.  Rumours began to mount in the newspapers that Norton would soon take over Ross' television slot.  Alan Yentob, the BBC's Creative Director, said that \"[y]ou don't need to compare Graham with Jonathan Ross.  No decisions have been taken with that slot.\"  \nIn 2008, Ross was involved in the infamous incident involving Russell Brand and himself leaving obscene messages to actor Andrew Sachs via a voicemail service. Regarding his departure from the BBC, Jonathan said: \"Although I have had a wonderful time working for the BBC, and am very proud of the shows I have made while there, over the last two weeks I have decided not to re-negotiate when my current contract comes to an end. While there, I have worked with some of the nicest and most talented people in the industry and had the opportunity to interview some of the biggest stars in the world, and am grateful to the BBC for such a marvellous experience. I would like to make it perfectly clear that no negotiations ever took place and that my decision is not financially motivated. \n\"As I have said before  I would happily have stayed there for any fee they cared to offer, but there were other considerations.  I love making my Friday night talk show, my Saturday morning radio show and the Film Programme, and will miss them all.  Working at the BBC has been a tremendous privilege, and I would like to thank everyone who has watched and listened so loyally over the last 13 years.\""}

Fire authorities were forced to close Shiloh Road, a busy street which runs adjacent to the complex, for several hours while multiple city units  fought to douse the blaze. Eye witnesses report that screams of animals and people were heard. A local news source described the blaze as \"massive\", adding that while no-one was injured during the blaze, one cat was killed. One witness told a local news agency: \"It engulfed it pretty quick. It's amazing to see how quick a fire can go like that. It just started on one end and took over.\"\n8 apartment units were reportedly totally destroyed in the incident. Initial reports indicate that the fire started in an upstairs apartment and spread rapidly. Local medical personnel were alerted to expect a large number of casualties. A woman, who lives in the neighboring apartment complex and was present during much of the event, spoke to Wikinews on the condition of anonymity. \"It was unbelievable,\" she said. \"There were firetrucks and police cars everywhere. It was the biggest fire I've ever seen.\"\nFire officials have stated that they believe the cause of the fire may have been faulty wiring, adding that there was no evidence to suggest arson. On Thursday morning, local news outlet KLTV reported that many residents of the complex praised the fast and aggressive response of local firefighters. 61-year-old Cecile Hughston said that she was in her home about one block from the fire when she saw the flames. She said: \"I was inside my house and I could see the flames, they were stretching up toward the sky. I was terrified.\" Multiple clean-up workers were present at the complex on Thursday morning and the damaged building was cordoned off with police tape. "}

You know, if you're not willing to produce an original certificate like a birth certificate, then you've got something to hide.\" The Republican, three-term mayor of the central Illinois city made the comment to a man holding a video camera during a Tea Party protest at West Side Park in Champaign. The man who recorded him apparently was an anti-Tea Party student from the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign. \nSchweighart's concerns reflect those held by some Tea Party proponents and \"birthers\", who claim that Obama is not eligible to be the president because he was not born in the United States. Although officials in Hawaii have confirmed that Obama was born there, birthers still insist that he has not proven his constitutional eligibility as a natural born citizen. \nChampaign County Board member Al Kurtz, declaring himself \"flabbergasted\" by the remarks, has called on the mayor to resign. \"It's a ridiculous statement to make, and that's why I felt like he polarized the city with those kinds of bias. I think from this statement, it will make him a very ineffective mayor,\" he said. \nOther local politicians are less concerned by Schweighart's comment, such as city council member Marci Dodds, who does not believe the mayor should resign. \"I respect the mayor greatly but I am somewhat disheartened by his comments. However, that was just a dumb comment. If we all get fired for making dumb comments, we'd sure be moving around a lot,\" she said."}

Its recent statement advances the forthcoming review conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to be held in New York next month. The declaration points out: \"Indeed, it is with a certain sense of relief we can state that since the mid-1980s, a large proportion of the more than 70,000 nuclear weapons have been reduced. Yet todays deployed nuclear weapons are still sufficient to extinguish modern civilization. In addition, nothing has changed about the fundamental inhumanity of nuclear armaments, because their use would affect military targets as well as civilian populations indiscriminately, and thus would be generally contrary to existing international humanitarian law, based on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.\"\nThe physicists are particularly concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons, expecting \"that a regional use of nuclear weapons could become more likely if more states or even terror groups obtain access to weapons-grade fissile material\". Having a closer look to the continued work of weapon laboratories of the nuclear powers, they state: \"We cannot accept that nuclear weapons continue to be developed today.\" Strengthening the non-proliferation requires the \"nuclear powers to meet their responsibility for complete implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\", who pledged in its Article VI \"to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament\".\nThe DPG addresses in its statement the perspective of a nuclear weapon free world as outlined by US president Barack Obama in his Prague's speech last year and that has been supported by Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev. Probably, the chances for the physicists have never been better before to achieve a complete abolition of nuclear weapons as it has been negotiated upon in the case of biological und chemical weapons. The continued development of such weapons of mass destruction appears to DPG and its members as \"inconsistent with the ethical principles to which we as scientists are committed.\""}

Wesley, who posted the news onto an Internet forum, is known for having also spotted last July's Jupiter impact event. Go caught Thursday's impact on video, which showed a fireball the size of Earth after the object hit. It could be the first time someone has recorded a meteor crashing into a planet.\nThis latest strike came only hours after a team from the Space Science Institute, led by astronomer Heidi Hammel, announced that last year's event was the result of an asteroid 1,640 feet (500 metres) wide. That asteroid caused a scar the size of the Pacific Ocean when it hit Jupiter with the force of several thousand nuclear bombs on July 19, 2009.\nThe planet last experienced a major impact in July 1994, when it was hit by Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9), resulting in large scars as well. Scientists originally thought that there would not be any more Jupiter strikes for several centuries following SL9, but have now been proved wrong twice in as many years.\nNow, astronomers around the world are trying to figure out what kind of mark Thursday's collision left on the planet, as well as determine exactly what hit it. Although the impact is believed to be relatively small, a dark debris field may soon appear in the clouds around Jupiter, which is what occurred in 2009."}

However, other news agency reports put the death toll as low as fifteen.\nAn official, who requested to remain anonymous, said the accident could have begun as a result of renovation work on the Djingareyber mosquewhich is made primarily of mud, and was built in the fourteenth century. Construction work blocked off some of the roads, and that could have been a factor in the incident. \"The mosque is being renovated, financed by the Aga Khan, and the work is carried out by South African specialists,\" the official told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency.\n\"Because of these renovations, the passage on the north side of the mosque is closed off. On that side, to get through, the faithful found an improvised alleyway. But the alley couldn't take the number of people using it. So there was a stampede. Somebody shouted 'someone has died' and panic took over,\" the same official went on to say.\nOthers have remarked that rescue services responded \"very quickly\" to the stampede, and helped the \"many injured.\"\nThe Xinhua news agency reports the stampede started when an elderly woman fell in one of the town streets near the city's main mosque, where a sermon was being conducted in front of a large crowd; a passersby then rushed to assist the woman, apparently disrupting the crowd's movement and causing the stampede.\n\"People were circling the mosque, a ritual at each Mouloud [the observance of the Prophet Mohammed's birthday] and there was a huge crowd build up,\" commented Mohamed Bandjougou, one of the witnesses to the event, to AFP by telephone. \"There were at least fifteen dead. The bodies were taken to the morgue.\"\nAuthorities warned the number of injured may actually be higher than reported, saying that \"we cannot rule out the fact that the number of those injured will increase because some of them are still hiding in their homes instead of coming to the hospital.\"  A hospital source commented that some of the people hurt were in critical condition, and needed to be evacuated to the capital, Bamako, as soon as possible.\nThe mosque's imam, who gave his name as Asseyuti, commented on the incident. \"We're in mourning. What happened is a real trauma. We accept the will of God.

A year after the swine flu pandemic was declared, stocks are left unused and governments try to abandon contracts, pharmaceutical companies have profited at least 4.6billion from the sale of vaccines alone.\nReports by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) and the Council of Europe claim that The World Health Organisation reaction to H1N1 was influenced by pharmaceutical companies and that key scientists behind advice had financial ties with firms Roche and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). These conflicts of interest have never been publicly disclosed by WHO, an apparent violation of its own rules.\nThe World Health Organisation issued H1N1 guidelines in 2004, recommending countries to stockpile millions of doses of antiviral medication. The advice prompted many countries around the world into buying up large stocks of Tamiflu, made by Roche, and Relenza manufactured by GSK.\nA joint investigation with the BMJ and the BIJ, found that scientists involved in developing the WHO 2004 guidance had previously been paid by Roche or GSK for lecturing and consultancy work as well as being involved in research for the companies. \"The WHO's credibility has been badly damaged,\" BMJ editor Fiona Godlee said in an editorial.\nA report by the health committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a 47-member human rights watchdog, found that the WHO's reaction was influenced by drug companies that make H1N1 antiviral drugs and vaccines. It criticised WHO lack of transparency around the handling of the swine flu pandemic and says the public health guidelines by WHO, EU agencies and national governments led to a \"waste of large sums of public money and unjustified scares and fears about the health risks faced by the European public.\"\nA spokesman for WHO said the drug industry did not influence its decisions on swine flu. Margaret Chan, the organisation's director, had dismissed inquiries into its handling of the A\/H1N1 pandemic as \"conspiracy theories\" earlier this year, she had said: \"WHO anticipated close scrutiny of its decisions, but we did not anticipate that we would be accused, by some European politicians, of having declared a fake pandemic on the advice of experts with ties to the pharmaceutical industry and something personal to gain from increased industry profits.\"\nYesterday, a 16-member \"emergency committee\" consisting of advisors from the World Health Organisation said that the H1N1  pandemic is not yet over.  The WHO has refused to identify committee members, arguing that they must be shielded from industry pressure, so possible conflicts of interest with drug companies are unknown. The BMJ report also reveals that at least one expert on the \"emergency committee\" received payment during 2009 from GSK.\nIn related news, Reuters reported, Pfizer Inc, the world's biggest drugmaker, is selling its swine vaccine business to Chinese Harbin Pharmaceutical Group for $50 million."}

A senior figure for Air Zimbabwe stated that he was \"concerned that this incident led to many, many calls to us. People were frightened. No actual plane was involved, but there was a scenario involving a Boeing 767 plane that had been hijacked and forced down at Harare airport.\"\nIt was reported that Peter Chikumba, chief of Air Zimbabwe, had also not been informed that the exercise was to take place, and that the airline had set up an emergency helpdesk to liaise with the families of victims. Alan McGuinness, a correspondent for Sky News, stated, \"journalists who arrived at the airport saw smoke rising from a runway and were then taken to a room where they were told to wait. David Chawota, the head of the Zimbabwe Civil Aviation Authority, said the media was duped to make the drill more realistic.\" Chawota stated, \"telling the media was part of the exercise. We wanted to see how the media would react,\" he said. \nChawota himself told BNO News that an airliner had crashed. Michael van Poppel, head of BNO News said that \"while I first thought Chawota was just misinformed by others, although that would be odd since he is the CEO of the aviation authority, I was stunned to hear that he actually knew it was a drill and wanted to see the media's response ... This basically means he was lying to me when I spoke to him, but also to other reporters he spoke to ... I think it was absolutely irresponsible of this CEO and I can't imagine what the families of passengers travelling to Harare around that time must have gone through when they heard news reports that there had been an 'accident' at the airport.\"\nMcGuinness reported, \"Stuart Sprake, general manager of FX Logistics, works at Harare airport and believed the secrecy surrounding the drill will help emergency crews learn valuable lessons.\" Sprake told reporters \"they (the crews) had to find their way through crowds and traffic ... training exercises should be ad hoc  the less people know about it the better.\""}

The video was up for two months, during which it was viewed 5,500 times.  Google Italy pulled it down two hours after being notified by police, following complaints by the boy's father and Vivi Down, an Italian organization representing individuals with Down syndrome.

It is fundamental, because identity is a primary good.  If we give that up, anything can happen, and that is not OK\", he stated.\nVivi Down said it was satisfied with the verdict and maintained that their aim was not to censure freedom of expression but to obtain a judgment on fundamental right to privacy.\nMatt Sucherman, Google Vice President and Deputy General Counsel for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, said that \"[the verdict] attacks the very principles of freedom on which the internet is built.\"  He continued that under European law, video-sharing sites are protected from liability for the content of material posted.  \"If that principle is swept aside and sites [...] are held responsible for vetting every single piece of content that is uploaded to them [...] then the Web as we know it will cease to exist, and many of the economic, social, political and technological benefits it brings could disappear.\"  He said Google will appeal the decision.\nDanny O'Brien, international outreach coordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation of San Francisco (an international non-profit digital rights advocacy group), described the decision as a \"threat\".  \"If intermediaries like Google or the person who hosts your Web site can be thrown in jail in any country for the acts of other people and suddenly have a legal obligation to prescreen everything anyone says on their Web site before putting it online, the tools for free speech that everyone uses on the Net would grind to a halt\", he said."}

Why hasn't the debate also been about creating more local jobs with greater diversity, so that long-term, people have the choice to avoid the road\/rail nightmare?\n((WN))  How would you go about creating said jobs?\nLM: I would lobby to make the Altona electorate attractive to businesses by questioning their needs when deciding on a location, then acting upon that information to provide for those needs. Improvements to broadband, road and transport infrastructure and access to leisure facilities are some of the areas that need to be examined.\n((WN))  Do you agree with some of the points made by Mr Hall in the previously mentioned interview? (Needs of traveller, the elderly, etc)\nLM: It is important for the needs of everyone who uses public transport that there is an efficient and effective public transport system, that is easily accessible no matter what age the traveller is. I have elderly parents and a toddler daughter so I can relate to the issues that affect a wide range of age groups.\n((WN))  Why should the electorate vote for you?\nLM: I'm not a politician, I don't come from a political background, I live in the real world, as part of a community where we raise our children and live our lives. Our electorate has been a safe seat for far too long to the detriment of our community. As the saying goes 'the squeaky wheel gets the oil'. 'Squeak.'"}

Gbagbo claimed victory in the nation's elections on November 28. Alassane Ouattara won the presidential run-off election on December 3 according to the country's electoral commission. However, the Constitutional Council has contested the announcement.\nThough the results are backed by the nation's top legal body, deadly protests have erupted with demonstrators and Ouattara calling the election a fraud.

The ambulance door was opened three times; the third time Tom jumped out and sustained injuries that left him in a coma. He became mute and dependant on 24-hour care. His only method of communication was to squeeze a hand.\nFrances was told that if she wanted Tom to die legally then she could ask the High Court to allow his food and water to be withdrawn, so that he would starve to death. Frances told the court \"I know Tom  no way would he have wanted to live totally dependent. I can remember saying I felt I would rather he go to heaven than to hell on earth. I know Tom would not want to live. He had lost his life.\"\n\"I couldn't bear the thought of Tom dying of thirst or hunger,\" she said of the idea of food and water withdrawal.  \"To me that would be so cruel, so cruel.  To die slowly like that would be horrible.\"  Instead she used the Internet to research Tom's condition and concluded that a heroin overdose would be the most painless method available.  A learning disabilities worker with no convictions, she concluded two grams was sufficient to kill and began spending time in areas she believed drugs were on sale  outside the local station, job centre and needle exchanges.\nFrances was determined to release Tom from his \"living hell\" and said she had \"no choice\" in the matter. \"I asked myself what I would want,\" she said. \"I would want someone to love me enough to help me die. That's why I thought heroin  a painless, peaceful death.\" She obtained her two grams and stole syringes from Tom's hospital before injecting him, but he was revived by nurses and she was charged with attempted murder. She was bailed but barred from contacting her son.\nFourteen months later she obtained access to Tom by posing as his aunt and placed superglue in the lock of his door, further barricading it with an oxygen cylinder and a wheelchair. It took staff thirty minutes to break in, by which time Frances had injected one of Tom's arms and both his thighs with heroin. This time he died.\nFrances had left a letter to her family in which she talked of her concerns for her other two sons and dog, as well as the running of the house, expecting a murder arrest. On one bed she left a photograph of Tom as well as a prayer written by his girlfriend. Police also found older letter by Frances, one of which read \"People keep saying Tom is not suffering. How can they know how he feels?\" \nShe was asked if guilty of murder and attempted murder, to which she responded \"I don't see it as killing or murder. The definition of murder is to take someone's life with malice in your heart. I did it with love in my heart, for Tom, so I don't see it as murder. I knew what I was doing was against the law. I don't know what name they would call it but I knew that the law would say it was wrong. I believed it would have been Tom's choice to have been allowed to die rather than have the intervention to keep him alive.\"\nThe jury \"could not have had a more difficult case,\" according to Judge Brian Barker, but he told them nobody was allowed to override the law. Ten members of the jury agreed, but two sided with Frances, leaving a conviction by majority verdict. The jury foreman was greeted by cries of \"shame on you\" from France's relatives, for which they were ejected from the building. \"We can all understand the emotion and the unhappiness that you were experiencing,\" Barker told Frances, later adding \"You knew you were breaking society's conventions, you knew you were breaking the law, and you knew the consequences.\" He ordered her to serve a minimum of nine years.\n\"What this case and a number of others have exposed,\" said France's eldest son, Alex, \"is a need for a complete rethink of existing laws in regard to people that have been, and will be, in the same position as Tom. How can it be legal to withhold food and water, which means a slow and painful death, yet illegal to end all suffering in a quick, calm and loving way? It's cruel, inhumane and illogical... We have a duty of care to them and we should not allow this situation to continue. It should not be left to a wife, husband, mother, father, sister or brother to have to end their suffering, and be convicted for murder.\" Detective Chief Inspector Steve Collin, who was in charge of the case, flatly disagreed. \"There's no such thing as a mercy killing in law.\"\n\"I want to say that all of the family and Tom's girlfriend support my mum 100%.

Speaking about this news, Ashcroft said: \"The loss of high street outlets, the slowdown in physical music sales as well as the challenges capturing the full value of music usage online has meant that for the first time we have seen royalties collected dip.

Investigations into the identity of the bombers and their motive are continuing.  The Real Irish Republican Army a paramilitary group that aims to bring about a united Ireland, has claimed responsibility.\nThe explosion on Culmore Road caused serious damage to nearby buildings, including Da Vinci's hotel and a branch of the Ulster Bank.  A telephone warning was given an hour beforehand and the area, including the hotel, was cleared.  The officers, standing near the edge of the exclusion zone, suffered injuries to their necks and ears when they were blown over by the blast.  \nChief Superintendent Stephen Martin from the Police Service of Northern Ireland asked for anyone who had seen the Vauxhall Corsa car in which the bomb was hidden before the explosion to come forward. Although the bomb, thought to be over 200lb, was left near the bank, Mr Martin did not think it was the intended target and said that the bomb may have been left because of the presence of police in the area.\nThe Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, called the bombers \"Neanderthals\" and \"conflict junkies\", and added that they were \"failing miserably\" to destroy the peace process in Northern Ireland. He is attending the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham; the Daily Mail reports he refused to comment on if the attack was to coincide with his absence. The city's mayor, Colm Eastwood, who was at the scene, said he was \"disgusted\", adding \"I do not know what these people are hoping to achieve.

The election follows  months of political turmoil after  the corrupt first round election in November caused a crisis requiring international intervention.   \nHaiti is still struggling to recover from  the devastating January 2010 earthquake, with about one million people remaining in squalid, temporary shelters and a recent  cholera epidemic which threatens to break out again with the return of the rainy season. Observers are  hoping the new president will restore enough  stability so rebuilding efforts can begin with international help.\nIn Haitis first round of balloting in November, names were missing from voter rolls, ballot boxes were stuffed or trashed, voters were blocked from the precincts by supporters of candidates, among other irregularities. Haitians rioted, plunging the process into chaos that was quelled by the determined efforts of foreign monitors. \nOut of the original 19 candidates, two remained after the first round: Mirlande Manigat, age 70, a sedate, reserved university professor and wife of former president Leslie Manigat, and pop star \"Sweet Micky\" Martelly, age 50, who the The Washington Post described as being \"a popular kompa singer [...] famous for dropping his pants on stage, mooning audiences, and dressing in drag  or sometimes a diaper.\"\nHowever, Martelly has waged an energetic, well financed campaign with  pink campaign posters picturing his smiling face and bald head, cultivating a populist image with  Haitis  poor. He has been successful at marketing himself as an  unpretentious outsider who will shake up the political system and yank the country out of its paralysis. At the same time, he has  courted the upper class with a platform containing pro-business promises and support for the return of the Haitian army.\nThe sedate personality of Manigat contrasts starkly with that of Martelly. She portrays herself as a dignified, mature mother figure able to nurture Haiti through its troubles. \nThe determining factor may be the popular former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who  returned two days ago to Haiti from South America after seven years in exile. Aristide has not endorsed either candidate, but Aristide supporters, among those Haitians most desperately poor, have voiced support for Manigat. Upon Aristide's arrival, there were banners saying, \"My mother is here already. Welcome home Father\", according to The Washington Post.\nPierre-Marie Boisson, a private-sector economist in Haiti, sees the candidates as having similar platforms, promising jobs, housing and free education, even if their personal styles are so different. \"They have both promised the moon to the voters,\" he said. He noted that this puts tremendous pressure on the winner to produce results quickly in a world where the price of food and fuel is rising.\nAs voting concluded, despite some irregularities such as  missing ballots and  late starts, authorities concluded  the voting went well, without the pervasive  fraud that marked the November election. Colin Granderson, head of Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission, said the runoff election was a great improvement over the previous one.\nThe final results will be announced on April 16."}

Half-brothers Adma and Abderhamane Karama, both 29, and Ibrahima Sow, 26, were convicted of attempted murder. The court found that they had used hunting rifles to shoot buckshot at police in Villiers-le-Bel over two nights of violence.\nThe Canadian Press names Maka Kante, 24, as also convicted of attempted murder. Adama was jailed for twelve years and Abderhamane for fifteen years; the brothers were described in court as the ringleaders of the shootings in the primarily black and Arab suburb. The Canadian Press says Kante received three years for his role. Sow will spend the next nine years in prison.\nSamuel Lambalamba, 24, was convicted of supplying a firearm to one of the rioters and jailed for three years. One defence lawyer, Michel Konitz, told the RTL radio station that he is uncertain whether his client will appeal \"even though he is not guilty.\" Another, Patrick Arapian, said \"[w]ith sentences this harsh, one can feel political meddling in the justice system.\" Prosecutors had sought between seven and twenty years for the accused.\nAccording to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the prosecution had struggled to find witnesses willing to testify among the locals. Instead, RFI says the case centred largely on anonymous written statements. The trial's last day stretched late into the night yesterday, with the verdict and sentencing following this morning. President Nicolas Sarkozy and his government are attempting to reduce violence in city suburbs.\nThe police union Alliance welcomed the convictions. They \"will give new confidence to our colleagues,\" according to spokesperson Ludovic Collignon, who called the trial \"symbolic\". The riots in November 2007 left 119 police officers injured. Rioters burned shops, cars, a police station, two schools and a library to total more than seventy vehicles and buildings.\nThe European Court of Human Rights has previously been asked to consider cases where the right to a fair trial may have been breached by the use of anonymous witnesses.

{"instructions":"Ian Baldwin, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, and colleagues have discovered a multi-step protective mechanism of tobacco plants against","gold_ref":"Ian Baldwin, of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, and colleagues have discovered a multi-step protective mechanism of tobacco plants against Manduca sexta  caterpillars. In response to a chemical in the caterpillars' larvae, the plants release an odorous substance into air to attract  another species of insects, called \"big-eyed bugs\" (Geocoris). These carnivores come to the scene and attack the caterpillars. The response is triggered within 24 hours, which is a relatively short period of time. The discovery occurred as a result of field studies in a nature preserve in southwestern Utah.\nThe phenomenon starts with the recognition of the caterpillars by the plant. As a PhD student in the Department of Molecular Ecology Silke Allmann explained, \"The plant cannot see its attacker, but plants can sense the digestive substances that attacking larvae have in their oral secretions when these substances come into contact with the leaves.\" To test that, the scientists coated some of caterpillars' eggs on two groups of tobacco plants and glued them. On one of the groups, the glue was mixed with caterpillars' split. The latter got more attention of the attackers, getting 25% of eggs destroyed against 8% for the other group.\nAllmann supposed that \"The simplest assumption is that the larval oral secretions contain a special enzyme, probably an isomerase, which rearranges the Z:E ratio of the aldehyde in favor of (E)-2-hexenal.\" The researchers heated the oral secretion to destroy the enzyme,  and applied it to wounded leaves. No plant response related to the studied process was observed, confirming the hypothesis.\n(E)-2-hexenal is a strong antibiotic agent. The food consumed by a caterpillar typically includes hundreds of microorganisms together with leaf tissue, which are mostly unneeded and killed by the above-mentioned substance quickly. Because of this important role of this substance, the caterpillars can't change their metabolism easily enough to prevent the subsequent events from happening.\nTo find out what happens after a caterpillar's presence is noted by the plant, Silke Allmann, a graduate student in Baldwin's group, examined the green leafy volatiles (GLVs), the substances responsible for the smell of fresh-cut plant parts. These substances are released into air if a plant is damaged. As the study released, the tobacco plant GLVs typically have a major share of Z isomers with very small amount of E isomers present. But the shares are distributed equally during a caterpillar attack. In a study with varying amount of different isomers present, E isomers turned out to be the ones attracting the predators to come to the scene and to attack the caterpillars.\nWhat is surprising, Silke Allmann found that the caterpillars are the direct stimulus of this change: caterpillar saliva converts the Z-isomers of the GLV molecules to E-isomers.  Prof. Ian Baldwin commented, \"That's where it got really weird. Why would a caterpillar do this to itself?\" He suggested that the E-GLVs could have anti-biotic effect in the caterpillar's digestive system.\nThe speed of the triggered reaction is relatively fast, it taking about one hour for the GLV isomers ratio change, and about 24 hours for the predators to be attracted by the substance released into the air. As Prof. Ian Baldwin, who was leading the research, said, \"Other indirect defense mechanisms of plants require the activation of new metabolic pathways for the release of odorant signals, and these responses are much slower.\"\nThe multi-step intricate approach involved is attracting the attention of scientists, who are looking forward to its application in agriculture. Baldwin noted that \"in effect, the caterpillar calls the police on itself\", and suggested to genetically modify crops to release similar signals to defend themselves against pests."}

The potential for loss in the Arctic is great.\"\nOdum believes that the climate in the arctic will make any spill easier to clean up because, \"Arctic conditions create differences in responding to oil in cold and ice conditions.  Differences in evaporation rates, viscosity and weathering provide greater opportunities to recover oil.  In Arctic conditions, ice can aid oil spill response by slowing oil weathering, dampening waves, preventing oil from spreading over large distances, and allowing more time to respond.\"\nHowever, Clausen believes that there are no current systems to remove oil from icy ocean waters. \nThis is not the first time that President Obama's administration has taken the environmentally cautious path in Alaska.

The research team concluded that a giant asteroid killed dinosaurs over 65 million years ago.  The asteroid crashed into Yucatn, Mexico creating the Chicxulub crater.  Their report was published Friday in the academic journal Science.\nIn 1980, Louis Alvarez and son, Walter, had published a paper stating that an asteroid had killed the dinosaurs.  The Chicxulub crater was also discovered in Mexico at approximately that same time, therefore the theory gained scientific acceptance.  More recent explanations of the cause of dinosaur's extinction included that perhaps volcanic eruptions on Deccan traps or multiple asteroid crashes ended the dinosaurs' existence.\nThe team performed chemical analyses of soil and fossil samples, where a high concentration of iridium (which is commonly found in asteroids and meteors) was found, which dated back to the approximate time of the asteroid crash. \nThe asteroid measured approximately 7.5 miles wide, and hit with an impact of one billion times the force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.  The impact would have immediately killed all animals and plant life within the radius of half of a continent.  With such an impact, debris would have flown into the air and then fallen back into the atmosphere with the force of a ballistic missile.\nThe crash of this asteroid into the earth would have also caused the equivalent of the heat of ten noonday suns, which would have burned the skin or feathers of dinosaurs, and created wildfires on any plant life which had survived to that point. The crash would have also triggered massive earthquakes and tsunamis, possibly causing parts of continents to fall into the ocean.\nThe area of Yucatn which the asteroid struck had also been rich in sulfur, which was blasted out of the earth and into the sky, where it would have mixed with water vapors, creating clouds that rained sulfuric acid, and which would block out the sun for approximately a decade."}

That's what the wave looked like for a minute,\" Garcia said. \"It was very stealth. You would have never known there was a shark in the water. It was all really quick.\" The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department stated that they believed the shark was between 14 and 20 feet (4.3 and 6.1 meters) long.\nThe pair had been in the water for about 45 minutes when a shark appeared and pulled Ransom under the waves, Garcia added. There was no warning. The shark appeared to be about 18 to 20 feet long. Ransom looked at his friend a couple of feet away and said \"Help me, dude,\" before getting lost in the waves, Garcia said. Ransom's parents confirmed that the shark tore his leg from his pelvis and Garcia attempted to revive Ransom with chest compressions, but he died from loss of blood. Witnesses told officials that the teenagers were about 100 yards (90 meters) from the shore when the shark attacked. Firefighters from the Vandenberg Air Force Base pronounced Ransom dead at the scene. \"He was a great guy and great friend,\" Garcia said.\nOfficials immediately closed local beaches after the attacks and they will remain closed for at least three days. Wildlife officials are still trying to determine what type of shark was involved, but based on the boy's injuries it is thought to have been a great white shark, who are known as the most frequent unprovoked attackers. Local lifeguards speculated the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity as Ransom was wearing a gray wet suit at the time, which may have made him appear as a seal.

The bacteria found was a form of fecal contamination, it was discovered, although it was not immediately clear whether it came from the soda fountains themselves, or people with dirty hands.\nOther bacteria were also found in the soda samples, including E.coli, present in eleven percent of the tested beverages. Many of the soda drinks apparently fell below the US Environmental Protection Agency's minimum standards for drinking water; regulations state that samples cannot test positive for E.coli bacteria. In total, 20% of soda fountains had more than the maximum recommended levels of bacteria.\n\"The large number of beverages and soda fountain machines containing E. coli is still of considerable concern [...] and suggests that more pathogenic strains of bacteria could persist and thrive in soda fountain machines if introduced,\" the authors of the study wrote.\nRenee Godard, the study's lead author, and a professor of biology and environmental studies at Hollins University, commented on the findings. \"Certainly we come in contact with bacteria all the time. It's simply that some bacteria may potentially cause some disease or gastrointestinal distress. One thing we hesitate with is that people get afraid of bacteria. Many of them are benign or helpful, but certainly, I don't want E.coli in my beverage,\" she said.\nGodard and her team took samples of 90 different beverages from three groups - sugar soda, diet soda, water - from 30 fast-food restaurants in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\"You can get collections of bacteria in the water line and that then runs through the whole machine and gets in to the beverage. Any time any water or liquid sits somewhere, it's just a breeding ground for bacteria,\" commented Primary Care Physician Alanna Levine.\nExperts suggest that plastic nozzles used on soda fountains might be part of the reason why the study found so much bacteria is present; it takes only a single dirty hand to spread bacteria over a tube, and it could be easily transferred to the rest of the fountain from there. \n\"It could be from dispensing with a hand that wasn't clean or using wet rags to wipe down the machine. We haven't done the work to really identify those potential sources and how these bacteria get established,\" Godard said.\nA professor at the University of California Davis, however, said he believed that a single localised study wasn't enough to come to a conclusion about soda machines throughout the country. \"How sanitation regulations are promulgated and enforced in a community are different. Some communities are more on to it than others. How much of a threat it represents? It's probably limited. Once again, it's a matter of what regulations are in place, who pays attention and whether it's being followed,\" he said, as quoted by CNN.\nThe National Restaurant Association responded to the university's findings in an e-mail statement. \"While the results of this study are disconcerting, we feel that it isn't representative of our industry and that our guests can safely enjoy beverages from dispensers and single-serve containers alike,\" the organisation said.\nThe American Beverage Association also countered the findings. \"Fountain beverages are safe.

His execution was performed by five volunteer riflemen. Gardner would not have seen his executioners due to bright lights during his final words before a bag was placed over his head. The execution was carried out at a prison in Draper, a suburb of Salt Lake City.\nThis is the first execution by firing squad carried out in the United States since John Albert Taylor on January 26th, 1996.  Taylor was convicted of raping and then murdering an eleven year old girl. Gardener chose his death by firing squad because he murdered with a gun and so stated he would die by the gun. The first man in Utah to be executed by firing squad was Gary Gilmore in 1977 for murdering two people. \nIn 1985, Gardner was convicted of fatally shooting a lawyer, Michael Burdell, during a failed attempt at escaping a courthouse. This was during his trial for the murder of Melvyn Otterstrom in 1984.\nThe five volunteers were not informed if they were given a live or blank round to ensure that they did not know if they gave the lethal shot.

Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff used the Twitter micro-blogging site to say he had given the go-ahead for execution. \"May God grant him the mercy he denied his victims\". Friends and family members had gathered outside the prison to hold a vigil with some wearing t-shirts showing his prison number, but none were allowed to view the execution.\nIn 2004, Utah passed legislation stating that all death-row inmates will be killed by lethal injection, however those sentenced before 2004 are allowed to opt for the death by firing squad, as Gardner did."}

The epicenter of the earthquake was 78kilometers (48mi) west of South Pagai, one of the Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra. \nWe are predicting that people will need food supplies and shelter. The rain is coming down very hard, the wind is very strong, a local police officer said, addind that emergency posts had been set up and patrols were being made to try and locate the missing. An official said that they had purchased 200 body bags \"just in case.\"\nA local official said that most of the buildings in the coastal village of Betu Monga had been destroyed when the tsunami struck. Of the 200 people living in that village, only 40 have been found. 160 are still missing, mostly women and children, he said. We have people reporting to the security post here that they could not hold on to their children, that they were swept away. A lot of people are crying. Food supplies, he added, were running low. \nWisnu Wijaya, the preparedness director with the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the government is getting aid to the islands. \"We already sent a rapid response team to this area, coordinated by the provincial government. We have local disaster management at Padang, because right now the condition of the wave is quite high,\" he said. Wijaya added that high waves and stormy weather have made it difficult to reach the affected areas, and communication was a problem. Emergency shelters have been set up and the first team from Sumatra was arriving Tuesday evening to begin a rapid assessment of the aid that was needed. \"Up to now, I think we still can manage this problem. Maybe also we'll send staff to go there and make a better coordination. If they need national resources to deploy there, we'll be ready to support local government,\" Wijaya said.\nThe head of the regional government in the affected area told local television that some of the people recorded as missing may have moved to higher ground to take refuge from the waves. Rick Hallet, who was aboard his boat when the earthquake struck, told Australian television: \"We threw whatever we could that floatedsurfboards, fendersthen we jumped into the water. Fortunately, most of us had something to hold on to ... and we just washed in the wetlands, and scrambled up the highest trees that we could possibly find and sat up there for an hour and a half.\" The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a statement saying that radio contact had been lost with a tourist boat in the area which could have been nine Australians and a Japanese national. A humanitarian organisation said that there were \"genuine fears\" for those aboard. \nA spokesperson for a surfing resort on the coast of North Pagai said that they had experienced a level of devastation that has rendered the resort inoperable. Witnesses suggested that villas at the resort had been wiped out by the tsunami. One report suggested that a 10feet (3m) wave had hit the resort, causing boats to burst into flames. There was a lot of debris floating in the water, including bar stools and other pieces of furniture from Macaronis Resort, a member of staff said. Reports suggested that water had reached rooftops in North Pagai.\nIndonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area prone to seismic shifts that spark earthquakes and volcanic activity. A massive earthquake in 2004 caused a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people across the Indian Ocean. After that disaster Indonesia worked to establish early warning systems and disaster management programs to help deal with future quakes."}

The teams fought out a 00 draw at Rugby Park,  a game which did not see many shots on goal with only nine in the whole game.  It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005.\nKilmarnock had previously been two points clear of twelfth position, occupied instead by Falkirk.  The team in last place would be relegated, and, only needing a draw, Kilmarnock played a slow and defensive game. It is the first time Falkirk have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2005. With only two shots on target the entire game, much of the credit for the draw went to each team's defensive line, putting in several last-ditch tackles to stifle attacks.\nWhile Falkirk had the upper hand in the first half possession-wise, the contest was more even in the second.  On 77 minutes, the Falkirk side had the ball in the net, but the goal was disallowed for a clear foul on the Kilmarnock goalkeeper.  Shortly after, Kilmarnock clipped the crossbar with a Craig Bryson effort.  Falkirk had a glorious opportunity to win the game on 86 minutes, when the ball landed for Ryan Flynn with the goal empty, but the young midfielder put it over from ten yards.\nKilmarnock manager Jimmy Calderwood, speaking after the game, spoke of his experiences: \"It was a long, long day. I wouldn't advise it for anybody to be honest, you know. It's the first time and hopefully the last time.\n\"They didn't really cause us any problems. We had a chance on the counter attack, we didn't take it, and then I think it was the 92nd or 93rd minute young Flynn missed a dottie of a chance. It could have been over and out. All credit to Falkirk.\"\nWhen asked about his future at the club, Calderwood replied: \"I'll see what the idea is. I wouldn't want to stay with too many games like this.\"\nThe manager of Falkirk, Steven Pressley, also told Radio Scotland his views on the game: \"It was a very emotional day, you know, we're bitterly disappointed, but once again I couldn't ask any more from this group of players. The things we talk about, the desire, the effort, the application, they were in abundance today. They gave me their absolute lot. It just wasn't to be.\"\nThis was Pressley's first season as a manager, and he was questioned on his experience in the role: \"I love it. It's been an emotional day today, but in terms of my three months in charge, it's been a terrific experience. I very much enjoy it here and hopefully we can certainly build for next season.\"\nFalkirk will be replaced in the Scottish Premier League next season by Inverness Caledonian Thistle, who bounced straight back into the top flight after their relegation in 2009."}

Currently, only around 65% of American households have broadband connectivity; if approved, the new plan would increase that number to 90% by 2020.  According to a statement from the FCC, the plan would provide a \"foundation for economic growth, job creation, global competitiveness and a better way of life.\"\nOpposition to the plan is largely based on two points, which are cost, estimated be as much as $350 billion, and the effect on current users of airwaves, which new broadband access would use.  According to the FCC, the plan would end up being revenue-neutral, thanks to income from the auctioning of airwaves, although in past such auctions revenue has gone to the US government. Separately, the proposal would include some changes to regulations over Internet lines, which are largely opposed by the industry, as well as plans to introduce a new fee for use of the airwaves, which are currently untaxed."}

{"instructions":"Tony Blair, former prime minister of the United Kingdom, appeared before the Iraq Inquiry today.

He faced six hours of questioning, starting at 6:30 am, at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London concerning his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. During the inquiry, Blair stood by his decision to invade, saying he would make the same decision again.\nThis is the third time Blair has given evidence at an inquiry into the Iraq War, having already testified before the Hutton Inquiry and the Butler Review, as well as participating in an investigation by the Intelligence and Security Committee. The Hutton Inquiry found that the government did not \"sex up\" the dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Butler Review uncovered \"serious flaws\" in pre-war intelligence, and this inquiry was set up by current prime minister Gordon Brown in order to \"learn the lessons\" of the war. Sir John Chilcott, the inquiry chairman, began by stressing that Blair was not \"on trial\", but could be called back to give further evidence if necessary.\nAt the end of the session, Chilcott asked Blair if he had any regrets, to which Blair replied that he was \"sorry\" that it was \"divisive\", but said that invading was the right thing to do since he believes \"the world is a safer place as a result.\" Blair said that the inquiry should ask the \"2010 question\", which refers to the hypothetical position that the world would be in if Saddam Hussein were not removed from power. He said that \"today we would have a situation where Iraq was competing with Iran [...] in respect of support of terrorist groups\".\nAt the inquiry, the topics on which Blair was questioned included his reasons for invading Iraq.\nAt the time, he said that his reasons were based on a need to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction; however, interviews held later suggest that removing Saddam Hussein from power was his primary objective. Blair denies this, asserting that the need to dispose of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was the only reason for the United Kingdom's participation in the invasion. He explained that, in an interview with Fern Britton, he \"did not use the words regime change\", and, what he was trying to say was, \"you would not describe the nature of the threat in the same way if you knew then what you knew now, that the intelligence on WMD had been shown to be wrong\".\nHe said, despite no weapons of mass destruction being found by UN weapons inspectors, he still believes that Saddam Hussein had the means to develop and deploy them; \"[h]e had used them, he definitely had them [...] and so in a sense it would have required quite strong evidence the other way to be doubting the fact that he had this programme [...] The primary consideration for me was to send an absolutely powerful, clear and unremitting message that after September 11 if you were a regime engaged in WMD [weapons of mass destruction], you had to stop.\"\nHe also said that weapons of mass destruction and regime change were not separate issues, but \"conjoined\", since \"brutal and oppressive\" regimes with such weapons are a \"bigger threat\" than less hostile nations with the same weapons. He said that Hussein's regime was hiding important information from UN weapons inspectors, and had \"no intention\" of complying with them. He asserted that  he has \"no regrets\" about removing Hussein, \"[a] monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world.\"\nThere were also questions about why the UN weapons inspectors were not given more time in Iraq in March 2003. Blair responded by saying that it would have made very little difference, as Iraq had the knowledge and \"intent\" to rebuild its weapons program from scratch if it were dismantled. He was also asked whether he still believed that the war was morally justified. He said that he did. He also said that the war was required because more diplomatic solutions had already failed, and the \"containment\" of Hussein's regime through diplomatic sanctions was \"eroding\" when the decision to invade was made.\nHe also said that attitudes towards Saddam Hussein and the threat he presented \"changed dramatically\" after the 9\/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York. He said, \"I never regarded 11 September as an attack on America, I regarded it as an attack on us.\" He said that he believed terrorists would use biological and chemical weaponry, and also said, \"if those people inspired by this religious fanaticism could have killed 30,000 they would have. My view was you could not take risks with this issue at all.\"\nHe later said, \"When I talked earlier about the calculus of risk changing after September 11 it's really important I think to understand in so far as to understanding the decision I took, and frankly would take again. If there was any possibility that he could develop weapons of mass destruction we should stop him. That was my view then. It's my view now.\"\nHe was also asked about his supposed commitment to George W. Bush that United Kingdom would join the United States in an Iraq war, which he is said to have made at Bush's Crawford ranch in 2002. Blair stubbornly denied that this took place, saying that what was said is that Saddam Hussein had to be \"dealt with\", and that \"the method of doing that is open\". Instead, he says, his reasons for the invasion were moral.\nHe also said, \"This isn't about a lie or a conspiracy or a deceit or a deception. It's a decision. And the decision I had to take was, given Saddam's history, given his use of chemical weapons, given the over one million people whose deaths he had caused, given 10 years of breaking UN resolutions, could we take the risk of this man reconstituting his weapons programmes or is that a risk that it would be irresponsible to take?\"\nHe said of Bush: \"I think what he took from that [the meeting] was exactly what he should have taken, which was if it came to military action because there was no way of dealing with this diplomatically, we would be with him.\" He did admit, however, thata year later, as the invasion approachedhe had been offered a \"way out\" of the war, which he declined. He said of this, \"I think President Bush at one point said, before the [House of Commons] debate, 'Look if it's too difficult for Britain, we understand'. I took the view very strongly thenand do nowthat it was right for us to be with America, since we believed in this too.\"\nAnother line of questioning focused on his 45-minute claim, which was included in the September 2002 dossier but redacted after the war. It states that Hussein was able to deploy nuclear weapons within 45 minutes of giving the order. This dossier also contained the words, \"the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons\". However, the inquiry has revealed that there were certain caveats involved, so the claim was notanti-war campaigners claim\"beyond doubt\", especially since senior civil servants have told the inquiry that intelligence suggested that Hussein's weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled.\nBlair said that it \"would have been better if (newspaper) headlines about the '45-minute claim' had been corrected\" to stateas he admits he should have made clearthat the claim referred to battlefield munitions, rather than to missiles. He says that, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have liked to have published the intelligence reports themselves, since they were \"absolutely strong enough\". He did insist, however, that the intelligence that was available at the time put it \"beyond doubt\" that Iraq was continuing to develop weaponry. He added that \"things obviously look quite different\" after the war, since weapons of mass destruction were not found.\nOne of the main topics was the legality of the war. Earlier this week, a senior Foreign Office legal advisor claimed that the war would be illegal without a further United Nations Security Council resolutionwhich was not obtained. The attorney general at the time, Lord Peter Goldsmith, said that the cabinet refused to enter into a debate over the legality of the war, and that Blair had not received his advice that a further UN resolution would be needed warmly. He insists that he \"desperately\" tried to find a diplomatic solution to the problem until France and Russia \"changed their position\" and would not allow the passage of a further resolution.\nBlair also said that he would not have invaded had Goldsmith said that it \"could not be justified legally\", and explained Goldsmith's change of mind by saying that the then attorney general \"had to come to a conclusion\", and his conclusion was that the war was legal. He did not know why Goldsmith made this conclusion, but said he believes that it may be due to the fact that weapons inspectors \"indicated that Saddam Hussein had not taken a final opportunity to comply\" with the UN.\nQuestions were also asked on the government's poor post-war planning, and claimed confusion about whether the US had a plan for Iraq after the war was over. Blair was drilled about the lack of priority that was given to the issue of post-war planning. He was also asked about the lack of equipment that British soldiers were given. This line of questioning was pursued in front of the families of some of the soldiers who died in Iraqmany of whom blame the poor equipment for the deaths of their relatives.\nThe families of some of the 179 British soldiers killed in the Iraq war, along with around 200 anti-war protesters, held a demonstration calling for Blair to be declared a war criminal outside the centre in London's City of Westminster. They chanted \"Tony Blair, war criminal\" as the former prime minister gave evidence inside. Blair was jeered by a member of the audience as he made his closing statement, and the families booed him, chanting \"you are a liar\" and \"you are a murderer\" as he left the centre.\nIn order to avoid the protesters, he arrived early and was escorted by security as he entered through the back door, with large numbers of police officers standing by. One of these protesters, Iraqi Saba Jaiwad, said, \"The Iraqi people are having to live every day with aggression, division, and atrocities. Blair should not be here giving his excuses for the illegal war, he should be taken to The Hague to face criminal charges because he has committed crimes against the Iraqi people.\"\nAhmed Rushdi, an Iraqi journalist, said that he was unsurprised by Blair's defence of the invasion, because, \"A liar is still a liar\". He also claimed that the war had done more harm than good, because, \"Before 2003 there were problems with security, infrastructure and services, and people died because of the sanctions, but after 2003 there are major disasters. Major blasts have killed about 2,000 people up till now. After six years or seven years there is no success on the ground, in any aspect.\"\nCurrent prime minister Gordon Brown, who set up the inquiry, said before Blair's appearance that it was not a cause for concern. Anthony Seldon, Blair's biographer, called the session \"a pivotal day for him [Blair], for the British public and for Britain's moral authority in the world\". Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who opposes the war, said in Friday's Daily Telegraph that it was \"a pivotal moment in answering a question millions of British people are still asking themselves: Why did we participate in an illegal invasion of another country?\" He called the invasion \"subservience-by-default to the White House\", and questioned the \"special relationship\" between between the United Kingdom and the United States.\nVincent Moss, the political editor of the Sunday Mirror newspaper, criticised the inquiry for being too soft on Blair. He said, \"A lot of ground wasn't covered, and in my mind it wasn't covered in enough detail, particularly the dodgy dossier in September 2002. There wasn't very much interrogation on that, they pretty much accepted what Tony Blair said about the intelligence. We could have had an awful lot stronger questioning on that\".\nIt is feared by some senior Labour Party politicians that today's events could ignite strong feelings about the issue in voters, and thereby damage the popularity of the party, which is already trailing behind the Conservative Party with a general election required in the first half of the year."}

{"instructions":"The mystery of the location of a viewpoint used by English painter John Constable has been solved, after nearly 200 years.  The Stour Valley and Dedham Church","gold_ref":"The mystery of the location of a viewpoint used by English painter John Constable has been solved, after nearly 200 years.  The Stour Valley and Dedham Church was painted in Suffolk, England, between 1814 and 1815, but changes to the landscape meant that the spot he chose was not known, despite the best efforts of historians and art experts.\nNow the puzzle has been answered. Martin Atkinson, who works for the National Trust as property manager for East Suffolk, used clues from the painting and looked at old maps to track down the viewpoint. Trees had grown, a hedgerow had been planted and boundaries had moved or disappeared, but Atkinson eventually worked out where Constable had stood.  He said, \"When I discovered that I had worked out the location where Constable painted this particular masterpiece, I couldn't believe it. All the pieces of the jigsaw finally fitted together.\"\nAtkinson used an 1817 map of East Bergholt, where Constable grew up, as a reference point, but found that the view would have changed not long after the painting was completed.  \"The foreground didn't fit at all, it was quite unusual as we know Constable painted it in the open air so he would have been standing in the scene. The hedgerow in his work no longer exists and there's another hedgerow that runs across the scene today which wasn't there. When you stand on the road on which he would have stood, and use the oak tree as a reference point, you see the same view. It's great to see where an old master stood  and be inspired by the same view,\" he said.\nSuffolk, where Constable painted many of his finest paintings, is often called \"Constable country\". Most, but not all, of the locations that Constable depicted are known.  The picture is now housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts."}

The fees target baggage which is stowed in overhead bins, and not under seats. The fees will take effect for travelers who fly on or after August 1.\nSpirit will charge US$45 for passengers who pay at the airport, US$30 for those who pay in advance, and US$20 for members of its frequent flyer program. Spirit already charges between US$1545 for the first checked bag, and up to US$345 for five checked bags.\nThe move is the latest in an industry trend which is moving to lower upfront fares, and more hidden fees such as baggage fees or the loss of free services such as meals. Even the measure of charging passengers for restroom use as has been proposed by Irish carrier Ryanair. Ryanair also closed all of its check-in desks in 2009, relying more on on-line check ins.\nThere has been a push among US lawmakers to introduce legislation to make the pricing of airfare more upfront by listing the post ticket fees. The backer of a proposed bill to enforce this, Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, said that it will allow travelers to understand all the charges from when they book the flight to when they check their bag."}
{"instructions":"The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that the captain of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which crashed nearly a year","gold_ref":"The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that the captain of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which crashed nearly a year ago outside Buffalo, New York during its approach to Buffalo Niagara International Airport, \"inappropriately responded to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the aeroplane did not recover,\" according to a statement issued by the NTSB.\nThe flight, operating as a codeshare with Continental Airlines under their Continental Connection brand, crashed last year on February 12, 2009 in Clarence Center, New York. The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, crashed into a residence killing everyone on board as well as one on the ground.\nThe NTSB has blamed pilot error and poor training for the crash, noting that the plane's captain, Marvin Renslow, \"had not established a good foundation of attitude instrument flying skills early in his career, and his continued weaknesses in basic aircraft control and instrument flying were not identified and adequately addressed.\" Renslow's career spanned two decades and had failed five performance checks during that time. Colgan Air was only aware of three. Colgan said had they known about the other two, they would not have hired Renslow in 2005. \nColgan Air responded to the NTSB report in a letter: \"They [the pilots] knew what to do in the situation they faced that night a year ago, had repeatedly demonstrated they knew what to do, and yet did not do it. We cannot speculate on why they did not use their training in dealing with the situation they faced.\" \nThe Board added that Renslow's response to the \"stick shaker activation should have been automatic, but his improper flight control inputs were inconsistent with his training and were instead consistent with startle and confusion. The 24-year-old first officer, Rebecca Lynne Shaw, was noted for her young age and lack of experience.\nThe Board also concluded that \"the pilots' performance was likely impaired because of fatigue.\" Renslow and Shaw had spent the night at the crew lounge at Newark Liberty International Airport in violation of Colgan Air's company policies. However, the board voted down making fatigue a contributing factor. Shaw, the first officer, had flown the previous night on two separate planes from the Pacific Northwest where she lived with her parents. Shaw also appeared to be suffering from a bad cold.\nHowever, the report also criticized Colgan saying that the airline, \"did not pro-actively address the pilot fatigue hazards associated with operations at a predominantly commuter base.\" Adding that, \"Operators have a responsibility to identify risks associated with commuting, implement strategies to mitigate these risks, and ensure that their commuting pilots are fit for duty.\"\nAnother factor brought up the by the NTSB was the violation of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) sterile cockpit rule. It was noted that first officer Shaw had sent two text messages before take-off at Newark. The second message was sent two minutes before take-off.\nPrior to landing, the cockpit voice recorder recorded that the pilots were holding a conservation that potentially distracted the captain from operating the plane. Robert Sumwalt, a member of the NTSB board said, \"It was continuous and one-sided, with the captain doing most of the talking.\" He added, \"It was as if the flight was just a means for the captain to conduct a conversation with this young first officer.\" \nThe chairwoman of the NTSB, Deborah Hersman, has noted that electronic devices are becoming a hazard to transportation. Hersman said, \"Recent NTSB investigations have identified personal wireless technology use on the job. This phenomenon is becoming more widespread, and these phone calls, texts and other distractions have deadly consequences and must be addressed with all due haste by the transportation industry.\"\nThe agency noted that distractions from electronics have played a part in many recent accidents and incidents, such as the August 2009 mid-air collision between a small private Piper aeroplane and a tour helicopter over the Hudson River in New York City killing all involved. The NTSB noted that one of the air traffic controllers was making a phone call and failed to warn the aircraft of the conflict that existed between each other in their airspace. However, this was disputed by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association which represents air traffic controllers nationwide. The NTSB later retracted some of its statements.\nThe other notable incident was that of Northwest Airlines Flight 188 in October, that overshot its destination of Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport by 150 miles (241 km) before the pilots noticed. The pilots claimed they were checking schedules on their laptop computers in violation of basic piloting rules, the sterile cockpit rule and the policy of Delta Air Lines, who had recently acquired Northwest.\nThe NTSB's last board meeting which was held two weeks ago, about the 2008 train collision between a Metrolink commuter rail train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, California also pertained to distractions by electronic devices. In the statement released by the NTSB for that meeting, the board stated that \"according to records from the wireless provider, on the day of the accident, while on duty, both the Metrolink engineer and the Union Pacific conductor used wireless devices to send and receive text messages.\" The NTSB has recommended that audio and video recorders be installed in locomotive and control cabs because of the collision."}

According to his attorney, this condition was imposed because Manning made a \"sarcastic quip\" about the harsh conditions of his confinement.\nFor most of the eight months he has been held there, Manning has been required to sleep only in his boxer shorts because he has been under \"prevention of injury watch,\" according to First Lieutenant Brian Villiard, a spokesman for the Quantico facility. David Coombs, Manning's legal representative for the upcoming court marshal, said that on Wednesday Manning complained of his clothing restrictions and joked that if he wanted to, he might be able to harm himself \"with the elastic waistband of his underwear or with his flip-flops.\"  \nOn Wednesday night, the brig commander determined that Manning must give up his boxer shorts also. Villiard said, \"The intention is to ensure the safety and security of the detainee and make sure he is able to stand trial.\" Villiard, citing privacy rules designed to protect the detainees, did not explain how Manning could harm himself if allowed to wear his underwear. \nCoombs said Manning was not put under a suicide watch because that would have required the decision of a mental health professional. As a result of the tightening of Manning's conditions, he will be required for the indefinite future to sleep naked in his cell, and endure, according to Coombs, the \"humiliation of standing naked at attention for the morning roll call\".\nIn a statement, Senator John Kerry suggested recent publicity will cast light on Manning's situation and the balance between humane treatment and suicide prevention: \"I think that a lot of people are now reviewing this very, very closely, people have weighed in, myself included, I think that analyses are being made. ...

Their study follows a recent African outbreak of the disease this parasite causes. The discovery is expected to help develop a cure preventing future deaths.\nThe 19982001 sleeping sickness epidemics in South Sudan, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda caused tens of thousands of deaths.  The parasites are spread by tsetse flies.  It is considered one of the worst epidemics in the last five decades.  As WHO reported, subsequent recent introduction of population screening in rural areas and distribution of more effective drugs had potentially reduced the number of death incidents.  However, the main effect of these measures being a decrease in spreading of the parasite and not in decrease of the death rate, the researchers decided to tackle the puzzle.\nThe scientists studied the molecules the human immune system activates in response to the attack.  They were looking for the way the parasites inhibit it and lead to the death of the victim.  Of the several known parasite species, the two that can infect humans were chosen to study, called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense.  Several others also exist, but they affect only animals.\nResearchers knew that the Trypanosoma attacks typically are repelled by an HDL, more specifically trypanosome lytic factor-1 (TLF-1).  It is generated in the humans' immune system and is toxic to the parasites but not to humans.  It was known that one of the parasites, T. b. rhodensiense, has evolved an inhibitor of the toxic chemical, called Serum Resistance Associated (SRA) protein.  However the other one, T. b. gambiense, was responsible for over 95% of human deaths, and it had been previously unknown why. \nThe study showed that a gene mutation has lead to a change in the parasite's surface protein receptor.  It doesn't bind to TLF-1 as well as for other species, leading to a substantial decrease in TLF-1 uptake by the parasite.  The receptor is more strict, causing a lower nutrient intake as well, but it suffices, and the parasite defends against the human immune system. \nAs professor and head of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at UGA (and one of the leaders of the research) Stephen Hajduk explained, \"Humans have evolved TLF-1 as a highly specific toxin against African trypanosomes by tricking the parasite into taking up this HDL because it resembles a nutrient the parasite needs for survival. But T. b. gambiense has evolved a counter measure to these human 'Trojan horses' simply by barring the door and not allowing TLF-1 to enter the cell, effectively blocking human innate immunity and leading to infection and ultimately disease.\"\nBased on the results of the research, humans could possibly develop a defense mechanism to keep the parasites from evading the human defense system.  Stephen Hajduk commented, \"We believe this research represents a paradigm shift and causes us to think more broadly about how pathogens avoid host defense mechanisms.  It turns out that African trypanosomes have evolved a diversity of ways to avoid human innate and acquired immune systems.\""}

This is the conclusion","gold_ref":"Human brains cannot manage more than 150 friendships  even with the advent of social networking websites like Facebook, Bebo and Myspace.  This is the conclusion of Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Dunbar originally carried out research in this area in the 1990s, looking at social groups from modern offices back to ancient villages. He found that the neocortex in the brain, used for thinking and language, cannot cope with more than 150 friends  a conclusion known as \"Dunbar's number\". Groups of people tend to be limited to about 150 as, beyond that, social cohesion suffers. Revisiting the topic, Dunbar's view is that this number has not increased even with online methods of keeping in touch with friends, like Facebook.\nDunbar compared the online activity of those with thousands of internet friends and those with hundreds, before concluding that there was no appreciable difference in their levels of activity.  He defined a friend as someone that the individual cared about and made contact with at least yearly. \"The interesting thing is that you can have 1,500 friends but when you actually look at traffic on sites, you see people maintain the same inner circle of around 150 people that we observe in the real world. [...] People obviously like the kudos of having hundreds of friends but the reality is that theyre unlikely to be bigger than anyone elses\", he observed. \nAnother conclusion of his study was that women were better at keeping friendships going on Facebook than men  \"girls are much better at maintaining relationships just by talking to each other. Boys need to do physical stuff together\". The full results of his study are due to be published later in 2010.\nDunbar, 52, has been an Oxford professor since 2007, having previously been Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Liverpool.

He said, on a televised broadcast in Chile, that \"Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shown that there is no link between celibacy and paedophilia but many others have shown, I have recently been told, that there is a relationship between homosexuality and paedophilia. This pathology is one that touches all categories of people, and priests to a lesser degree in percentage terms.\" He also claimed to have documents of scientific studies proving his claims.\nHis statements were immediately criticized by several gay rights groups in both South America and Europe.  The president of Italy's largest such group, Arcigay, Paolo Patan, says \"The equation between homosexuality and paedophilia is a false, despicable and anti-scientific statement that affects the lives and dignity of millions of gay and lesbian people. It confirms the cynicism and cruelty of the Vatican hierarchies, which have covered sex crimes committed by members of the church for years throughout the world against thousands of innocent boys and girls\". Gaylib, a conservative gay group, condemned the statement, saying that it was \"worrying that the foreign minister of a state that occupies the heart of the Italian capital would use arguments that are considered pass even in the Third World.\" \nThe president of Chilean gay rights group, Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation in Chile, Rolando Jimnez, said that the statement was \"a perverse strategy by the Vatican to shirk its own ethical and legal responsibility by making a spurious and disgusting connection.\"\nThe cardinal's statements are not the first time the Catholic Church has made allegations of a link between homosexuality and paedophilia.  In 2005, the Vatican prohibited men from becoming priests if they \"showed deeply rooted homosexual tendencies.\"  The move came shortly after a major child abuse scandal in the United States, and the move was seen as implicitly linking homosexuality with paedophilia."}

When children have AD36 antibodies, that means they had the virus at some point in their life.  AD36 causes colds and eye infections. \nComparing the obese children who had the antibodies versus the obese children who didn't have the antibodies, the kids with the antibodies were significantly more obese, at 35 pounds heavier.\nThis shows that body weight regulation and the development of obesity are very complicated issues,\" Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer, the study's lead author, said.  Schwimmer also said that \"[i]t's not simply a case that some children eat too much and others don't.  There are children who eat all the wrong things in all the wrong quantities who are not obese.\"\nSchwimmer said that he's not blaming the US childhood obesity epidemic on the virus, but noted that \"Ive seen children who had very brisk weight gain in a given year for reasons that were very hard to pinpoint. These may be the children who have obesity related to this infection.\" \nThe study is backed up by past reports that show the virus boosts production of fat cells. In studies in which animals were infected with AD36, the animals gained a significant amount of weight.\nThere is currently no vaccine for AD36, and no routine screening for the virus.  Dr. Goutham Rao, clinical director of the Weight Management and Wellness Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said that \"People want a magic solution.  Unfortunately, we don't have one.  What people can do is focus on a child's behaviors and eliminate the unhealthy behaviors.\"  Rao also said that \"Instead of coming to the doctor and requesting a test for the virus, parents would do better to discuss key behaviors to combat obesity.\"\nDr. James Cherry, specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), was also interested by the study.  He said that if the link between AD36 and obesity were confirmed, developing a vaccine for the virus could be worthwhile.  \"More than 20 percent of the obese children in this study were positive for the antibody.  If we could prevent 20 percent of all obesity, that would be pretty impressive,\" Cherry said."}

Earlier in July of this year California recommended that anyone over seven years old who was not fully vaccinated for Pertussis get a Tdap pertussis booster.\nSome parents are refusing to have their children vaccinated against the disease and the vaccine has worn off in some adults.

Its main opposition the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), which is the governing party of incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy, is predicted to be defeated. The election results, while marked by low turnout, strongly favored leftist candidates according to official returns. This has given the ruling right wing party a blow in the last nationwide election before the 2012 presidential elections. \nWhen 96% of votes had been counted, candidates from the Socialist and other leftist parties had won 53.6 percent votes according to the Interior Ministry. The conservative UMP party and other right-wing candidates won 39.8 percent. The far-right National Front outdid expectations with 12% of the vote. It seems to be favored by voters concerned about immigration and the growing Muslim population. According to polls the Socialists will win with a majority in the second round in all 26 regions of France. The Socialists already control twenty of the twenty two regions on the French mainland.\nSarkozy has dismissed this result as  regional voting, regional consequences, but indicated his intention to slow the pace of reforms and make a minor cabinet reshuffle. Prime Minister Franois Fillon said \"It's not over. Everything is open\" before the decisive runoff on March 21. He urged voters who missed the first round to come out for the second round, \"at a moment when the economic and financial crisis demands sang-froid, courage and unity.\" Jean-Franois Cop, a leader of Sarkozys parliamentary group said We had massive abstention  that is, an absolute record,. Sarkozy supporters argued that the triumphalism of the leftists had been tempered by the record voter abstention, on television debates.\nSocialist leader Martine Aubry, in a speech to supporters Sunday night, called the result \"encouraging\". \"By this vote the French people have sent a clear and strong message of refusal to a France that is divided, anguished and weakened,\" she said. She urged supporters to come out again next Sunday to give a win to hope that Sarkozy could be defeated in 2012. \nFormer Socialist Prime Minister Laurent Fabius called it \"an excellent halftime for the Socialists,\" saying that voters wanted to voice their displeasure against Sarkozy's policies. He said the high rate of abstention indicated Sarkozy's failure to motivate citizens facing economic crisis and record unemployment. Sgolne Royal, expected to be Sarkozy's Socialist opponent in 2012 called this election \"a severe sanction vote\" against Sarkozy.\nThe 81-year-old National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, said, \"The National Front was declared beaten, dead, buried by the president. This shows that it is still a national force, and probably destined to become greater and greater\". He appeared on national television after the vote, holding a poster banned by a court that reads: \"No to Islamism.\" He called on voters to back the party again in round two, saying his party was \"combative and capable of rebuilding this country, which is in a horrible state.\"  \nThe National Front has tied for third-place nationally with Europe cologie, the green-minded party campaigning about climate change, each winning 12 percent of the vote.\"Europe cologie is the third political force,\" in France, said Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a leader of the party. It has frayed a \"tremendous path,\" he said. His candidates are expected to align with the Socialists in many regions for the runoff polls.\nSarkozy had promised reforms to make the economy more dynamic before he was elected in 2007. But he changed this free-market strategy when the financial crisis hit and called for \"moral capitalism\" and proposed limiting bankers' bonuses and global regulation of hedge funds. Sarkozy's successful intervention to keep carmaker Renault from outsourcing jobs to Turkey and stimulus packages failed to lower the 10% unemployment rate inviting anger of the French citizens and causing his approval rating to fall below 40 percent. He was not able to stop the numerous strikes and protests by factory workers in recent months. He also started the 'Burqa' debate on the basis of which the far-right National Front has succeeded.\nTurnout was estimated to be around 48 percent of France's 44 million eligible voters, a sharp drop from the roughly 60 percent who voted in 2004."}

Defence officials speaking to The Guardian have floated the idea as Western powers examine ways to turn the tide of the rebels' stuttering campaign against forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi. \nThe sources also urged Arab countries to fund training for the rebels, whose inferior weaponry and organisation is widely agreed to have allowed pro-Gaddafi forces to check the insurgency's recent gains.\nThe call to deploy private security contractors comes as the Afghan government has announced plans to phase out such operators over the next 12 months. The image of such firms has been severely tarnished by repeated revelations of abuse by the U.S. firm Blackwater Worldwide, subsequently renamed Xe Services. Blackwater executives and employees have faced civil lawsuits, criminal charges and Congressional investigations related to accusations of bribery and murder in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe collapse of numerous investigations related to several alleged incidents has raised questions about the legal accountability of firms operating in war zones on behalf of Western governments.\nThe suggested training of rebels and deployment of contractors appears to confirm Western powers' determination to end Gaddafi's grip on power. \nYesterday's report in The Guardian interprets the move as the start of a new phase in the three-week-old NATO-led intervention in Libya, and a tacit admission by Western nations that the rebels are struggling to make ground despite NATO air support. \nBritain's focus on Arab participation in funding and training the rebels reflects a will on Western powers' part to foster Arab ownership of the intervention, perceived as being crucial to building the legitimacy of the West's support to Libyan rebels.\nAccording to The Guardian, Western military strategy is now turning to cementing the rebels' territorial gains before the negotiation of a ceasefire with the Gaddafi regime."}

A number of councillers challenged her plans, however, claiming that the opposite had been happening. \nThe Bucks Free Press reported that councillors asked Pope why community hospital beds are being closed and why more clinics are being centralised. The Overview & Scrutiny Committee for Public Health Services was told that an \"under-used\" gynaecology clinic located at Buckingham Community Hospital was moved to Stoke Mandeville, which one councillor said was already too congested. \nYou're bringing things into Stoke, but there's such a lot of congestion there...

Chalfont St Peter councillor, Bruce Allen, said of the revelation: We've never had an answer from anyone of any intelligence to say what's going to happen. We had a community hospital with 29 beds and it served us well. We keep asking when it's going to be opened and we get nil answers. I've been to so many meetings and heard this nonsense. We can't get an answer from anyone.\" \nMrs Pope replied by saying that she could not give a \"definitive answer,\" but said that she considered Chalfont's to be \"an important part of the jigsaw. Mrs Pope was told by the chairman of the Buckinghamshire County Council committee that she had \"a duty\" to inform residents of the futue of the hospital. Unfortunately there's always a reason for delaying it,\" said Mike Appleyard. \"All I'm saying is sorry, no longer. We expect you to be here within six months with some answers on the community hospitals.\nHedley Cadd, another councillor, attacked the gynaecology transfer, saying that he and his wife were forced to travel for four hours to get to and from Stoke Mandeville Hospital, for a consultation that lasted only twenty minutes. Mrs Pope responded by saying that she was \"very aware\" of the issue, conceding that because the clinic is only 40% full, \"those clinics are being denied to somebody else. Mrs Pope said that it was too early to say how the Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, a new organisation which is the result of a merger between the Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust and several community hospitals, would manage local hospitals. \nAnne Eden, Chief Executive of the new organisation, said: We felt it was important to change our name to reflect the wide range of services we now offer patients from our hospitals and in community settings and in peoples own homes. In addition, discussions took place with staff across the organisation alongside patient representatives to evolve our five patient promises to reflect our extended range of services which underpin everything that we do.\""}

The report, released  February 10, accused the archdiocese of a decades long  cover up.\nAccording to the grand jury,  at least 37 priests had continued in their duties around children despite  \"substantial evidence of abuse against them\".   \"We understand that accusations are not proof,\" the report said, \"but we just cannot understand the Archdiocese's apparent absence of any sense of urgency.\" The grand jury  had seen the files of only  20 priests, it said, and in those cases the archdiocese had dismissed credible allegations of abuse  on trivial grounds, such as a victim failing to remember the year in which the priest served or the exact layout of the rectory.\nThe Cardinal's initial statement in reaction to the  report denied there were any active  priests \"who have an admitted or established allegation of sexual abuse of a minor against them.\"  However, days later, he  hired a former sex crimes prosecutor to review the personnel files of all those named in the grand jury's report.\nYesterday's statement placing the 21 priests on leave came more than two weeks after the grand jury released its report. Cardinal Rigali, while apologizing for the behavior of priests abusing minors, said the leaves   were temporary  measures until full  investigations are completed. \nThis mass suspension for sexual abuse is notable in that it is one of the largest in the history  of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. The slow response of the Philadelphia Archdiocese to sexual abuse allegations goes against the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' own 2004 Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People which says any priest with creditable allegations should be removed immediately and investigation of the case should follow.\nAlmost a decade ago, allegations of sexual abuse by Philadelphia priests surfaced. A grand jury report issued in 2005 detailed numerous cases of abuse allegations, some decades old,  involving Philadelphia  priests and the  efforts of their superiors to cover up the evidence. The 2011 grand jury found that the panel formed by the archdiocese to handle the complaints in the  2005 report primarily  protected the church rather than the victims.\nDavid Clohessy,  the director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), an advocacy group for survivors and their attorneys, said, \"Many victims and Catholics in Philly, are left seriously wondering how effective the bishops' so-called reforms really are, if dozens and dozens of credibly accused priests in one archdiocese alone are kept in ministry for years.\""}

{"instructions":"On Monday, Australian telecommunications company Telstra has introduced dual carrier HSPA+ standard for broadband Internet business customers in the Next G network. This is the first time","gold_ref":"On Monday, Australian telecommunications company Telstra has introduced dual carrier HSPA+ standard for broadband Internet business customers in the Next G network. This is the first time this technology is being introduced on national scale. The bandwidths the users can deploy increased into two to three times, with Telstra becoming the worlds fastest national mobile broadband service. The switch started with enabling the service for premium users. After some feedback, Telstra may expand the plan.\nThe higher speeds for wireless are intended to simplify and ease multitasking of users.\nJohn Paitaridis, Telstra's executive director, network products and services in Enterprise & Government, said \"One of the reasons we decided to launch first to Enterprise And Government and Business customers is that clients are saying that their ability to access applications quicker makes a difference to their business and when they start to equate time savings and doing calculations around productivity it does become a return on investment.\"\nTelstra Business Group Managing Director Deena Shiff also stated that the efforts aren't as sudden as it might seem, having feedback of many users as the base.\nPrevious modems were able to reach peak speed 21Mbps, with real life speeds ranging from 0.5Mbps to 8 Mbps. The theoretically expected maximum of the new technology is 42Mbps with user speeds varying between 1.1 and 20 Mbps. The new speed is twice as fast. This is caused by that the dual-carrier \"Evolved High-Speed Packet Access\" technology allows networks to send and receive wireless data using two channels simultaneously. This technology can be deployed on Next G networks. Telstra switched to them in February, thus making the switch to HSPA possible now.\nTelstra delayed the implementation of the new technology until elections end. This decision was intended to avoid wrong interpretation of them by Coalition. Coalition's claims include that wireless networks can be an alternative to the Labor party \"fibre-to-the-home\" proposal to introduce more expensive wired Internet. The announcement of the new technology, initially planned on August 25, was delayed, with Telstra spokesman Craig Middleton explaining, \"We just didn't want to feel like we were influencing the [telecommunications] debate.\"\nThe political parties have different plans on development and funds on the Internet. The Labor party aims to spend AUD 43 billion to bring 1 Gbps wired Internet nationwide, and the Coalition plans to spend AUD 6 billion to introduce a variety of improvements including upgrade of existing copper Internet as well as expansion of wireless Internet to support 12Mbps. Opposition leader Tony Abbott has said in the past that Australians shouldnt assume wireless technologies wont ever be comparable to fixed-line technology. Telstra's upgrade shows that wireless broadband is reaching the 100 Mbps minimum speeds promised by Labor's national broadband network.\nTelstra has only 2000 devices which support the new technology. This is why the opportunity to try it out is being given only to the Business plan customers, and they receive it for the same price as they were paying for the previous NextG plan. Since October 5, the device will be available for sale, with the Business customers able to buy it with 75% discount and a prepaid data allowance. The upgrade is expected to cover roughly 50% of the population. This is happening at the same time as one of Telstra's competitors Vodafone is doubling data download quotas on mobile cap plans.\nAs some testing showed, real life download speeds reached only about the half of the maximum. Telstra executive director of wireless Mike Wright explained that the predicted figures were the estimates, with real life speeds lower due to interfering environmental conditions: \"It's possible to achieve better than the typical user speed claims, but those claims occur in the ideal network environment with good signal quality. When you're out on the streets you get a lot of variation where the network is subject to signal quality, your location and the network load.\""}

The boy, who has not yet been identified, was found behind a Spar convenience store in the town of Cwmcarn at 1815 GMT on Tuesday. The baby was found to be wrapped in a towel which was in a plastic shopping bag. Bystanders who were walking past the scene mistakenly believed that the bag had been unintentionally left there by a person who had visited the gym that is located next to the store.\nA 14-year-old boy, who is the son of the man who owns the convenience store, then examinied the bag and discovered the baby. He made a phone call to the emergency services, however, when the baby was taken to Royal Gwent Hospital, it was pronounced dead on arrival. The baby was younger than one day old at the time of his death. A post-mortem examination proved to be indeterminate. Gwent Police have now launched an investigation to try and determine the identity of the baby's mother.\nGursewak Singh, the father of the person who discovered the baby and the owner of the shop, explained: \"We asked friends and colleagues what the bag was doing there, but it didn't belong to anyone. A boy who works with us said it was just a towel in there and he didn't open it. In the evening I went out to it and opened it, only saw a towel on top and didn't look thoroughly. I just thought it was clothes underneath and didn't want to root through them. I picked it up and hanged it on the gatepost so someone walking by might see it and recognise it as theirs. At about six o'clock there was a power cut and my 14-year-old son went out and picked up the bag and opened it and saw a little head in there. He called his uncle and said: 'It's not clothes, come and look'. They came over and saw the baby in there.\" Singh commented that this incident \"was shocking. We were all devastated. I wish we had checked earlier. If we had gone through the bag we could have made a difference. I'm worried what sort of condition the person who left the bag is in. We are so concerned about her.

A convoy of 140 vehicles running from Tall, in Hangu District to the town of Parachinar in Kurram Agency, FATA was targeted.\nThe victims, some of them women, were at a petrol station in Hangu. The wounded were taken to adjoining hospitals.\nAccording to police, the attacker detonated a bomb near a fully loaded bus. The convoy carried several people, vehicles filled with provisions and commodities for trading. A majority of the people in the group were Shia Muslims. \nNo one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. Several insurgents have attacked the country's North West Frontier Province in the last year. Earlier, three died in another suicide attack on a police station in Karak, located in the same area.\nMany Shi'as dwell in the Parachinar and Orakzai area which has been home to violence in the past. The Tall-Parachinar road was closed to the public in 2008 and 2009 due to Taliban activity. The latter targeted Shia Muslims, sources say. The road was re-opened about two months ago, with convoys guarded by security forces forming the bulk of the traffic.\nHangu borders Pakistan's tribal regions, where several militant groups are believed to be operating. However, security forces say that arrangements have improved from the past."}

The protest","gold_ref":"The president of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, was met with a 250-strong protest today, during his visit to Birmingham, England. The protest was held outside the International Convention Centre (ICC) venue in the British city, where the president addressed supporters of his Pakistan Peoples Party and leading figures of the Pakistani community. Al Jazeera reported that two shoes were thrown at Zardari as he delivered his address, by a man who reportedly managed to break through police barriers to make a personal protest against the President.\nPakistan is experiencing the worst flooding in eighty years and it has been reported that the floods have now hit 14 million people. The president has faced criticism for continuing his tour during the crisis and though the messages of the protesters were many and varied, shown by placards ranging from \"Save Pakistan from American terror and Zardari\" to \"Stop killing innocent Christians, repeal blasphemy law 295 B and 295 A\", Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher said \"[the] one thing they all agree on is that he should not be here.\"\nInside the ICC, speaking to a group of supporters, Mr Zardari said the trip had been crucial in raising more than 20 million in aid from Britain and France and for resolving the diplomatic rift between Pakistan and Britain, caused by British Prime Minister David Cameron's comments about alleged Pakistani terror links. David Cameron said on July 28 that \"we cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and...promote the export of terror\". The Pakistani President has said that his European tour is essential to mend the diplomatic rift these comments have caused.\nThe President's son has also defended the tour, saying \"He's doing the best he can and what he thinks is best to help the people of Pakistan.\" He added that \"his personal presence in Pakistan would not be able to raise this much money.\" \nThe Financial Times said the President \"struggled at times to be heard above the chanting of hundreds of supporters.\" The chanting from the protesters arrayed outside the ICC could also be heard from where the President gave his speech. Many were calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.\nAccording to the Associated Press of Pakistan the President's trip has been kept as cheap as possible, with Mr Zardari staying in the \"cheapest five-star hotel in Central London\" while he met with Mr Cameron. But at today's protest many held placards decrying the fact that while money was urgently needed in Pakistan the President was taking a tour that would cost the country. Two examples of such placards were: \"Thousands dying president is holidaying\" and \"while Pakistan floods Zadradi enjoys\".\nThe demonstration was held in the shadow of the Hyatt Regency Hotel where Mr Zardari has been staying. It is one of the most expensive hotels in Birmingham but the raised bridge that links directly to the ICC does provide the best security for the President. \nMohammed Khalil, a local official from the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, told the AFP that \"He should be there organising for his own people. Instead he's here with so many people. The government is paying all the expense for that. That money should be spent on the people of Pakistan, not on himself.\" However the President's son said millions had been raised from Britain and France because of the tour, and that the President would return once worldwide attention had died down.\nThe protest itself carried on for many hours, from before 2:00 in the afternoon until 4:25, when it ended with a prayer ceremony. The protest reflected the prominence of the Islamic faith in Pakistani culture, with a tarpaulin stretched on the ground to allow for Muslim prayer. National feeling was strong, shown by the numerous Pakistani flags being flown, and the presence of the closing religious ceremony and Islamic prayer mirrors the close-knit relationship nationalist and religious feeling have in Pakistan."}

The change means that the entire network will be able to be integrated throughout, rather than having two operators effectively running two separate systems.\nNottingham City Council have selected Tramlink Nottingham as their preferred bidder to construct and operate the NET Phase Two lines to Chilwell and Clifton, and will now enter talks with the consortium, made up of Alstom, Keolis, Trent Barton, VINCI Construction UK, OFI Infravia and Meridiam Infrastructure, to finalise the exact details of the contract. It is expected that the concessionary contract will be awarded during the coming summer, with construction starting before the end of the year. The contract will run for 23 years.\nTramlink Nottingham chairman Roger Harrison said: \"Building on Arrow's successful legacy, we are excited to be taking forward the next chapter in Nottingham's tram story.\n\"Our focus now will be on working with Nottingham City Council to ensure NET Phase Two can be introduced at the earliest opportunity.\"\nThe reshuffle of operating consortium means that Nottingham City Transport (NCT)  the main provider of bus services within Nottingham  will have no part to play in the extended network, despite the numerous awards and high satisfaction levels NET has had since its opening; it is the only one of Britain's five light rail networks to be an instant success.\n\"We're obviously very disappointed not to be part of the selected preferred consortium. Nottingham's tram has won numerous awards and after seven years passengers continue to praise its operation. We would have relished the opportunity to have been part of this continuing success,\" said NCT's Managing Director Mark Fowles.\nBut the council stresses that they are still committed to the future of the company.\n\"This decision in no way reflects the excellent job Arrow Light Rail Limited has done operating the tram since its launch. Annual customer satisfaction figures remain very high and this is testament to this operation,\" added Jane Todd. \"The decision to appoint a new consortium to build and operate the extended tram network was made on the basis of selecting the best proposal to meet the council's objectives for the future of the tram system. The overall offer from the Tramlink Nottingham consortium was stronger. Although disappointing for NCT it is nonetheless good news for the integration of public transport services that the city's other major bus operator, Trent Barton, is part of the preferred bidder. I am certain NCT will continue to provide award winning bus services for the people of Nottingham.\"\nStaff currently employed by Arrow Light Rail are expected to be transferred over to Tramlink Nottingham around August, when further details of the contract will become clear. Other changes that are proposed for the network include 'smart card' ticketing  similar to the highly successful Oyster scheme that is in use across Transport for London's service  and the phasing out of tram conductors in favour of on-platform ticketing machines. Current conductors will be offered new roles within the company, though talks are still on-going about how to combat any potential fare-dodgers.\nFurthermore, an additional 22 tram vehicles will be built by consortium member Alstom for the extended network, though these will be of a different design to the 15 existing vehicles, which were built by Bombardier to their Incentro design for the system's opening. The new trams will be part of Alstom's Citadis family, and will bring the total tram fleet to 37. This will also allow for service frequencies to be increased and for overcrowding to be eased at peak times.\nTicketing arrangements for the network will also change when the new consortium takes over. Currently, combined tickets, cards and passes can be used for the tram and NCT buses, but these are due to be phased out and replaced with the new smart cards in time for the opening of the extensions. Prior to that, passengers will be able to use combined tickets, cards and passes for the tram and Trent Barton buses, in a similar arrangement to that which is already offered for NCT.\nPat Armstrong, director for NET, said: \"The move is very much towards more sophisticated smart ticketing, like the Oyster card in London. You use the same card but the money goes back to the company you are travelling with.\"\nThe extended network, new trams and numerous other changes should be fully operational by the end of 2014, but NET users and tramway enthusiasts had mixed views on the matter:\n\"I think it's a bad idea to phase out the conductors,\" said Andrew Blood, assistant editor of the Tramways Monthly e-magazine, \"Not only do they help with revenue protection, but they are also responsible for the high passenger satisfaction levels on the system. In short, they keep tram users feeling safe.\"\nGreg Smith, from Hucknall, was pleased that service levels were going to increase: \"The fact that the trams will be running more frequently is a massive bonus in my eyes. The service we get at [the Hucknall] end of the line is great already, but if [the trams] are running more frequently it's just another advantage of the system over the bus.\" But he was also wary of on-platform ticketing being brought into place: \"I'm not sure that losing the conductors in favour of ticket machines is the way to go, though.\""}

He trained as an obstetrician and began to work at the Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.  While he was working at the hospital Liggins began to investigate premature labor during his spare time.  His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would speed up the baby's foetal lung maturation.\nLater in his research Liggins used his surgical skills and found while experimenting on the pituitary gland of a sheep that the gland in the foetus controlled the timing of birth.  He also discovered that cortisol was the hormone responsible for the actual birth.  At the time of his research the President of the United States John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline lost a son who was born six weeks early.\nIn a controlled trial of pre-natal corticosteroids Liggins worked with Professor Ross Howie.  The pairs study showed a dramatic reduction in respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies.  The study was published in 1972. Liggins's research was the first treatment available to give a chance of life to premature babies.\nSeveral people have paid tribute to Liggins including Sir Peter Gluckman, the chief science advisor to the New Zealand prime minister.  He said \"Without doubt it is considered the single most important advance in obstetrical and perinatal research of the last 50 years\".  He added that Liggins was \"arguably the greatest scientist New Zealand had ever produced\".\nLiggins is survived by two daughters and one son. His wife Celia and another son had previously died."}

The Border Arbitration Agreement allows for international arbitrators to resolve a 20-year border dispute that dates back to the break-up of Yugoslavia.\nParliaments in both countries approved the deal, which will be binding on both countries. In March, Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor's centre-left government yielded to demands for a referendum on whether to accept a border deal. \"Solving the border dispute with Croatia is the basis for a lasting peace, security and friendship of both nations,\" Pahor said. \"If it is rejected, it is questionable how long I or my successor will need to reach another agreement which, I believe, could not be better.\" he added.\nThe national Electoral Commission said that after 99.9 per cent of votes were counted, 51.5 per cent voted for the deal and 48.5 were against it. It is impossible for the remaining 2,000 votes, cast by Slovenians living abroad, to change the outcome.\nSlovenia is situated between Italy and Croatia, where the dispute involves land on the Istrian peninsula in the northern Adriatic and the small Bay of Piran in the Adriatic Sea. A panel of five international experts will define the new land and maritime borders and could force Croatia to cede some of the sea it views as its own. In the past, Croatia has called for the border to be drawn down the middle of the bay. However, Slovenia, which has a much shorter coastline, feared that this would deny its ships direct passage to international waters.\nSlovenia is the only former Yugoslav state to have joined the European Union (EU), while Croatia hopes to conclude EU accession talks this year and join the twenty-seven member union in 2012. A rejection could have delayed Croatian membership. Slovenia has blocked Croatia's membership talks over the border issue in the past.

{"instructions":"PRS for Music is the UK's music royalty collection society tasked with working on behalf of copyright holders, specifically authors and music publishers.  Founded in 1914","gold_ref":"PRS for Music is the UK's music royalty collection society tasked with working on behalf of copyright holders, specifically authors and music publishers.  Founded in 1914, the PRS is a non-profit organisation with 350,000 UK businesses holding PRS licenses.  The society works in conjunction with PPL which collects fees on behalf of the copyright holders of the actual recording.\nSo, if a cover version of a song is played on UK radio, PRS collect a fee on behalf of the original writer and publisher, whilst PPL collect a fee on behalf of the record company of the cover.  In a recent Wikinews interview, Paul Campbell, founder of Amazing Radio, an unsigned UK radio station, lambasted PRS for their \"barmy standard contract\" and their outdated equipment.  That interview can be found here.\nWikinews reporter Tristan Thomas interviews PRS, following up on Campbell and others' criticism as well as finding out about future plans.\n((Wikinews)) Firstly, thank you for the time in doing this interview.\n((WN)) Last year, you were involved in a high profile dispute with YouTube.  Can you briefly explain to our audience what that was all about and the final outcome of it?\n((PRS)) PRS for Music was the first collecting society in the world to license the YouTube service, meaning if music videos were watched online then our members  who created them  would receive a small royalty payment.   When we went to renew the licence that YouTube held we couldnt agree as to how much should be paid and exactly what should be covered within it.   We believed that music had become a much larger part of the YouTube service and that YouTube\/Google should reflect the increased use of our members' creative talent in the amount they paid.    \nThe great thing is that we kept talking to YouTube throughout the dispute and managed to reach an agreement in September which meant that the videos could be accessed again by UK YouTube users and that our 65,000 songwriter, composer and music publisher members would be paid.\n((WN)) How many artists do you represent and how much did you collect during 2009 for them?\n((PRS)) We represent 65,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers.  We havent released our 2009 figures yet but in 2008 we collected over 600m for them.   The main sources of revenue come from recorded media (CDs, DVDs etc), international use, public performance use and use in television, radio and online. \n((WN)) Paul Campbell in a recent interview with us said the following:\n\"PRS has a barmy standard contract for using their members' music online. It requires us to pay them a fixed percentage of ALL revenue from that website  whether or not the revenue is derived from their members' work. So if we had 100,000 songs from non-PRS artists on amazingtunes.com, and one song from a PRS artist, we'd have to pay them a percentage of the revenue from ALL 100,000 songs. I.e., we'd have to take money out of the pockets out of non-PRS artists to pay to PRS. That would be immoral.\"\nHow do you respond to that?\n((PRS)) Anyone using music in a commercial way  such as a radio station  is required to obtain the permission of those that created the music.  This could be numerous writers, publishers and a record label for each song, possibly in different countries around the world.    By obtaining a PRS for Music and PPL licence in the UK you are ensuring you have those permissions for over 10million musical works. Obviously much of the music used on radio comes from non-UK writers who may not be members of PRS for Music.  Radio and television stations give us almost 100% accurate reports of their music use through their own playlists; this data then enables organisations such as ours to work out who should be paid and how much.  PRS for Music has 144 agreements in place with similar societies around the world, resulting in us representing almost 2 million writers worldwide.   If French, American, Spanish, Australian or any other writers music is used we will pay the respective societies so they can pay their members. \nSimilarly a writer of musician may be 'unsigned' by that doesnt mean that they shouldn't earn from their music when it is used by others.   Many bands, writers and performers are currently unsigned but by being members of PRS for Music they ensure that they can begin earning vital royalties that allow them to continue with their musical career.\n((WN)) How does the PRS ensure that artists outside the UK are properly compensated when their music is used within the UK, such as Thai or Chinese restaurants paying their PRS dues and exclusively using music which is from outside Europe?\n((PRS)) As mentioned before PRS for Music has agreements in place in over 90 countries around the world to ensure that when music is used the right creators are rewarded.   The system  built up over the last century  works both ways and when UK music is used internationally, PRS for Music receives royalties from foreign societies so we can pay our members.  In 2008 139.8m was collected from UK music use abroad, with the UK being one of only a few net exporters of music in the world.   \n((WN)) There have been a few cases in which PRS have been forced to apologise, exemplified by the threat of prosecution and a fine towards \"singing granny\" Sandra Burt, a shelf-stacker who sung to herself whilst stacking shelves.  How has PRS moved forward from these incidents in order to ensure they do not happen again?\n((PRS)) If we have made mistakes we will of course put our hands up and say so.  For example when we were approached about the Sandra Burt case  by a journalist incidentally and not Sandra  we did give out slightly incorrect advice, although the questions were a little ambiguous.  Once we realised our mistake we contacted Sandra to explain that she wouldnt need a licence to sing to her customers and offered our sincere apologies.  As an organisation we are very quick to admit where we get things wrong and ensure they are put right.  Were proud of our record with our customers and currently have 350,000 businesses choosing to use music in the UK.   \nTo put the complaints in context we have only have 1 for approximately every 5,000 customer contacts we make.  This is an exceptionally low ratio and there are many firms who would be envious of a record like this.  During 2009 our complaints fell by 50% and we appointed an independent ombudsmen who could handle any complaints if they were not resolved internally.  As of January 2010 no complaints have needed to be passed on to the ombudsmen.    \n((WN)) How does the PRS work with musicians who are not signed to major labels, may make music available for download via their own websites or MySpace, and do not have the financial resources to protect their copyright?\n((PRS)) Many of the PRS for Music membership is not signed to a major record label and we represent creators from all genres of music in the UK and abroad.  By joining PRS for Music, which only costs 10 deferred to your first royalty payment, you ensure you can begin earning royalties whenever your music is played, performed or reproduced.  We have worked hard to license such sites as YouTube, MySpace, Spotify and Sky Songs to name a selection to ensure our members can be rewarded when their work is used.    \nOur membership team also work hard to support our creators holding showcase events, offering advice of how to get their music used as well as legal and financial advice.\n((WN)) Finally, what future plans do you have as an organisation in order to further protect and enhance your members work as new technologies emerge over the next few years?\n((PRS)) PRS for Music will continue to be at the forefront of licensing new digital and online services to ensure creators are paid.   We aim to get the balance right to ensure new products and music services can launch and develop, but that also they pay for the music they use.   \nThe music industry is changing and the way we use music is continually changing (it always has) but well still be at the forefront enabling people to use music whenever they want, and rewarding those that have created that music.\n((WN)) Thank you for taking the time out for this interview.  Good luck for 2010.\nPRS for Music Official Website"}

It is exactly this kind of irresponsibility that makes clear reform is necessary.\"\nObama's two key proposals were to limit the types of operations that a bank may undertake and to limit the size of the largest financial firms.\nUnder the proposals banks would be prevented from owning or investing in hedge fund or a private equity fund. Nor would they be allowed to sponsor such funds. To limit size of financial institutions, further consolidation of the financial sector by restricting growth in the market share of their liabilities.\nObama called the restrictions on banking operations the \"Volcker Rule\" in reference to Paul Volcker, the chair of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. These activities are \"unrelated to serving their customers,\" Obama said.\nAccording to Obama, the current \"economic crisis began as a financial crisis, when banks and financial institutions took huge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses.  When the dust settled, and this binge of irresponsibility was over, several of the world's oldest and largest financial institutions had collapsed, or were on the verge of doing so.  Markets plummeted, credit dried up, and jobs were vanishing by the hundreds of thousands each month. We were on the precipice of a second Great Depression.\"\nThe President said his administration is seeking to protect consumers and close loopholes that allowed financial products such as credit default swaps without oversight. The goal would be to strengthen capital and liquidity requirements to make the financial system more stable. Another goal of Obama's reforms would be to ensure that the failure of one firm could not take the entire economy.\n\"We've come through a terrible crisis.

Sherrod spoke in March of this year at an NAACP meeting. The clip edited from the original video footage of this meeting misrepresents Sherrod as deliberately failing to support a white farmer because of his race. In reality, the full video revealed that Sherrod was speaking about racial reconciliation and the lessons she learned after the episode. However, the USDA asked Sherrod to resign before the full video was released. The farmer mentioned in the video and his wife later stated that Sherrod had actually helped to save their farm, and after the full video was made public, US Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and US President Barack Obama apologised and Vilsack offered Sherrod a new job with the USDA. However, Sherrod said that she has not decided whether to accept the new position.\nBreitbart said that he posted the edited clip to prove that the NAACP has racist elements, and has not apologised to Sherrod. Shortly before the video clip was posted, the NAACP had demanded that the Tea Party, a conservative activist group that Breitbart is active in, remove racism from parts of that group. \nHowever, Sherrod says that she no longer wants an apology. \"He had to know that he was targeting me,\" the 62-year-old said at a convention of the National Association of Black Journalists."}

Another member is lawyer Sobhi Saleh, a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is the largest opposition group in Egypt although officially illegal.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood has never been classified as a terrorist organization by the United States government, but some people in the US see it as a radical religious group.  The Brotherhood has officially said it \"envisions the establishment of a democratic, civil state that draws on universal measures of freedom and justice, with central Islamic values serving all Egyptians regardless of colour, creed, political trend or religion\".  The Brotherhood announced Tuesday it will apply for political party status, but will not field a candidate for president in elections to replace former President Hosni Mubarak as that might be divisive.  \"It's time for solidarity, it's time for unity, in my opinion we need a national consensus\", said a Brotherhood senior leader, Essam el-Arian.\nAmr El-Chobaki, of Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, remarked about the appointment of a Brotherhood member to the committee, \"I could have been concerned if there were no other [political] currents represented in the committee, which is not the case ... The Brotherhood is an existing [political] current and it is normal that it is represented [in such a committee]\".\nHosni Mubarak gave control of the country to the military when he stepped down on Friday after three decades of rule.

Ian Cruxton, deputy director of SOCA, said that the Euro had been chosen as the currency of choice by criminal gangs due to the large denomination of the notes, adding \"[i]t should now be impossible now to buy a 500 note over the counter from one of the suppliers.  And that's going to have an effect on the criminals  it means they are going to have to find other means of trying to move their money.\"\nThe note was introduced by the European Central Bank in 2002, when the currency itself officially entered into circulation.  The notoriety of the note's criminal uses has earned it the nickname \"the Bin Laden\" after Al-Qaeda suspect Osama bin Laden  something that everyone knows is out there, but law-abiding people rarely see. The Euro is the official currency of 16 European countries, colloquially known as the Eurozone, as well as unofficially in a further 4 nations.\nSince its introduction, there has been mounting international concern over criminal use of the large denomination note, which facilitates money laundering by allowing large concentrations of cash to be concealed in small spaces, for example, 20,000 can be concealed in a cigarette packet and 1million in 500 notes weighs 2.2kg while the equivalent in 20 notes weighs 50kg. The highest denomination note in Sterling is 50, making high-value denominations in other currencies, such as the Euro, tempting for those wishing to move large amounts of money.  \nWhen asked if criminal demand for the note would simply be displaced to other high-value notes, such as the 200 note (the next-highest denomination), Ian Cruxton, deputy director of SOCA said he believed that would be the case, however, with less of the 200 note in circulation, their movements would be easier to track than those of the 500.\nTourists returning to the UK from holidays in Europe will still be able to change their 500 notes for Sterling but will be unable to purchase them. The European Central Bank has no plans for a withdrawal of the note, given the legitimate demand for it in countries such as Germany and Italy, where cash is used far more frequently than alternatives such as credit cards.

Judt was known for his contributions to European history and his controversial position regarding the IsraeliPalestinian conflict.\nJudt's death was announced in a statement from New York University (NYU), where he was a professor. He died in his home in Manhattan, said the school. Judt is survived by his third wife, dance critic Jennifer Homans, and their two children, Nicholas and Daniel. Judt's first two marriages both ended in a divorce.\nTony Robert Judt, a secular Jew, was born on January 2, 1948 in London, but spent much of his adult life in the United States. The descendant of Marxist Lithuanian rabbis, he was sent to a camp in Israel as a teenager, and became a Zionist. Later, he spoke at a Zionist convention in Paris and worked as a translator for the Israel Defense Forces in 1967, starting with the Six-Day War.\nAn alumnus of King's College, he began teaching at NYU as Professor of European studies in 1987. Judt had previously taught at Cambridge, the University of California, and Oxford University.\nJudt, also an author, became a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his 2005 book Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945. The almost 900-page book covers the history of the development of Europe after World War II. He also wrote about topics such as the fall of Marxism and Communism.\nIn September 2008, Judt was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. One form of motor neurone disease, ALS targets nerve cells and causes a loss of speech and movement abilities. Left paralyzed and unable to breathe without assistance, Judt continued to lecture. Earlier this year, Judt was able to write a group of personal essays for The New York Review of Books, in which he discussed the disease. \"In contrast to almost every other serious or deadly disease, one is thus left free to contemplate at leisure and in minimal discomfort the catastrophic progress of one's own deterioration,\" he wrote. In 2009, Judt was the recipient of a special Orwell Prize, given to him for \"intelligence, insight and conspicuous courage.\"\nJudt's later views on Israel differed from those he had held as a teenager. In 1983, he called Israel a \"belligerently intolerant, faith-driven ethno state,\" opposing a two-state solution. Earlier this year, he wrote, \"most Israelis were not transplanted latter-day agrarian socialists but young, prejudiced urban Jews who differed from their European or American counterparts chiefly in their macho, swaggering self-confidence, and access to armed weapons.\" His stance on the topic was the subject of much controversy, even leading to his removal from the editorial committee for The New Republic."}

The woman, according to the police, then came into contact with the officer which inadvertently set off the gun that he was carrying. The bullet then struck the girl, Aiyana Jones, in the neck while she was sleeping on the family's couch.\nThe murder suspect was apprehended later that day.

As non-military technology it does not need an export license, and we would not normally need to monitor its sale and use abroad.\"\nThe statement went on to say, \"However, it is clearly of concern that it is being used as bomb detection equipment. As soon as it was brought to the attention of the Export Control Organisation and Lord Mandelson we acted urgently to put in place export restrictions which will come into force next week. We will be making an order, under the Export Control Act 2002, banning the export of this type of device to Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\nAdding, \"The reason the ban is limited to these two countries is that our legal power to control these goods is based on the risk that they could cause harm to UK and other friendly forces.\" The statement closed by saying, \"The British Embassy Baghdad has raised our concerns about the ADE651 with the Iraqi authorities.\"\nMeanwhile, the Avon and Somerset Police have arrested the managing director of the manufacturer, ATSC, 53-year old Jim McCormick on suspicion of fraud. McCormick is a former police officer from Merseyside. He has been released on bail.\nThese two events come after an investigation by the BBC's Newsnight program where they tested and revealed the device as a fraud. \nThe device, manufactured by ATSC Ltd. which operates from a former dairy in Sparkford, Somerset, contains an antenna attached to plastic hand grip which is attached to black box. It requires no battery or other power source, and is supposedly powered solely by the user's static electricity, the manufacturer claims. It can supposedly detect minute traces of explosives, drugs, human bodies, money, and even elephants provided it has the right card. \nThe black box of the device is intended to read \"programmed substance detection cards\" that are supplied with the device. The device supposedly works on the principle of \"electrostatic magnetic ion attraction\".\nNewsnight brought the device to Sidney Alford, a renowned explosives expert who advises all branches of the UK military. Alford opened up the card reader of the device which was empty. Alford said, \"Speaking as a professional, I would say that's an empty plastic case.\" Alford believes that the selling of the device is \"absolutely immoral\". He added, \"It could result in people being killed in the dozens, if not hundreds.\"\nThey then brought the \"programmed substance detection cards\" to the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The cards were examined by Dr. Markus Kuhn. When the layers of the card were peeled away, it was found that cards contained nothing but RFID security tags.\n\"There is nothing to program in these cards. There is no memory. There is no microcontroller. There is no way any form of information can be stored,\" said Kuhn. Adding, \"These are the cheapest bit of electronics that you can get that look vaguely electronic and are sufficiently flat to fit inside a card.\"\nThe device along with several others has been previously tested by Sandia National Laboratories in the United States. The test concluded that \"none have ever performed better than random chance. The United States Department of Justice has warned law enforcement agencies against buying the device.\nThe device first came to light in November of 2009, by The New York Times after an increasing amount of car bomb attacks were occurring in Iraq, including the devastating bombing on October 25, 2009, that killed 155. The bombers drove through checkpoints that were equipped with the ADE 651. However, the American magician and skeptic James Randi has been skeptical of the devices since at least October 2008. He offered a $1,000,000 prize if someone could prove the device worked.\nDespite what was brought to light by the Times, the Iraqi Interior Ministry stood by the device. Major General Jehad al-Jabiri, who is the head of the Ministry of the Interiors General Directorate for Combating Explosives, said, \"Whether its magic or scientific, what I care about is it detects bombs.\" \nIn response to the tests by Sandia Labs and the warning from the Justice Department, \"I dont care about Sandia or the Department of Justice or any of them. I know more about this issue than the Americans do. In fact, I know more about bombs than anyone in the world,\" the general said.\nEven after the Newsnight program earlier this week, the Interior Minstry still stands by them, \"We conducted several tests on them, and found them successful. In addition, we have a series of achievements officially documented by the Baghdad operations centre, from all the provinces, which establish that these devices detected thousands of bombs, booby-trapped houses and car bombs, and we've noticed a reduction of bombing activities to less than 10 per cent of what it was,\" said General al-Jabiri.\nInterior Minister Jawad al-Bolani even chimed in saying, \"The thing is, the instrument is being operated by a user. Not all those who use the instrument are fully trained, the user needs to be alert and adept at using it.\" The interior ministry has spent over $85 million on the devices, which cost from $40,000 to $60,000, much higher then price given by ATSC, $16,000, despite being warned by the ministry's inspector general, Aqeel al-Turaihi. \n\"There was corruption associated with this contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior,\" al-Turaihi told Reuters. He added, \"We said that the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally in the field of explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device.\"\nMeanwhile Iraqi Members of Parliament have called the Iraq Security Forces to stop using the devices. Hussain al-Falluji, a Sunni MP, said, \"I proposed to parliament the withdrawal of these machines from service, the formation of an investigative committee and that Iraq recover its money.\" Others in parliament are backing his suggestion.\nIraqi citizens are also criticizing the devices. Aqeel Yousif Yaqoub, a 39 year-old man who was caught in the October 25th bombing, said, \"If they were effective, how did the suicide car bomb reach this area?\" Another man, a perfume salesman named Malik Farhan, noted in June 2009 that the device was attracted to his perfumes. \nFarhan said, \"They stop us every time. There's nothing we can do.\" Jasim Hussen, an Iraqi Police officer, said, \"The vast majority of the people we stop, it's because of their perfume.\" Another officer, Hasan Ouda, added, \"Most people now understand it's what gets them searched, so they don't use as much.\" McCormick said in email, \"cheaply manufactured perfumes and some cosmetics\" contain trace amounts of the explosive, RDX.\nOther police officers have been doubtful of the device. \"I didnt believe in this device in the first place. I was forced to use it by my superiors and I am still forced to do so,\" said one police officer who spoke anonymously to the New York Times because he was not authorized to speak. Another officer blamed corruption: \"Our government is to be blamed for all the thousands of innocent spirits who were lost since these devices have been used in Iraq.\"\nMcCormick still stands by the device, saying, \"I have tested it in practice and it works effectively and 100% reliably.\" McCormick also talked to the The Times of London saying, \"We have been dealing with doubters for ten years. One of the  problems we have is that the machine does look a little primitive. We are  working on a new model that has flashing lights.\" However, an associate of ATSC, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of possible retaliation, said, \"Everyone at ATSC knew there was nothing inside the ADE 651.\" "}

That possibility still is being evaluated,\" said NASA in a statement to the press on Monday.\nKopra's injury comes amidst technical troubles with Space Shuttle Discovery's external fuel tank. While technicians work to solve the problems with the fuel tank, the rest of the STS-133 crew continue to train for their mission at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas."}

S. Guralnik at Brown University,  C. R. Hagen of the University of Rochester, and Tom Kibble at Imperial College London.\nThree papers written in 1964 explained what is now known as the \"Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble mechanism\" (or Higgs mechanism and Higgs boson for short).  The mechanism is the key element of the electroweak theory that forms part of the Standard model of particle physics.  The papers that introduce this mechanism were published in Physical Review Letters in 1964 and were each recognized as milestone papers by PRLs 50th anniversary celebration. \n\"There are six people who developed the mechanism in quick succession and who hold a legitimate claim to credit for it,\" says particle physicist Frank Close at the University of Oxford, UK.  Because the Swedish Royal Academy of Science can award Nobel prizes to no more than three people, this puts six men aiming for half as many Nobel medals, should the particle be found.  The Nobel committee can award the prize to groups and associations.\nFermilab's Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN are searching for a particle that will constitute evidence for this significant discovery.  Recent progress has given a new urgency not only to the race to find the particle, but also to establishing authorship of the ideas behind it. As John Ellis, a particle physicist based at CERN, acknowledges: \"Let's face it, a Nobel Prize is at stake.\" \nThe issue over credit and authorship was highlighted late July in France when the American and British team of Guralnik,  Hagen, and Kibble were omitted from the conference overview web site.  Several groups threatened to boycott and raised the issue in discussions of the theory behind the on-going search for the particle.  One of the meeting's organizers, Gregorio Bernardi at the Laboratory of Nuclear and High Energy Physics in Paris, admits that the committee was surprised by the strength of objections leveled at the web advertisement and the committee. \"People took this very seriously, which we didn't expect,\" he says.\nPhysicist Tom Ferbel said the snub by the French conference organizers was \"insulting\" and \"chilling\", noting that the American Physical Society awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics to all six physicists for this theory.  \"I do fear,\" he said, \"that the myopic views of the organizers could definitely impact the decisions of the Swedish Academy.\"\nThe conference organizers acknowledged that their choice was controversial by inviting a special talk on the tangled history of the mechanism, providing a forum for disgruntled conference participants to debate the matter. However, although the meeting ultimately ran smoothly, it seems likely that arguments over this issue will become more heated now that the Higgs particle is perceived to be within reach. As John Ellis states, \"I'm just glad that I'm not on the Nobel committee deciding who to throw out of the lifeboat.\""}

He was given two BRIT awards - one for 'Best British Single', which was Pass Out, and the second for 'Best British Breakthrough Act'. Upon receiving what would turn out to be his first award of two, Tinie Tempah proclaimed: \"I want to big up God and my family for sticking by me when times are hard.\" Canadian indie rock group Arcade Fire were also successful in achieving two BRIT Awards, one for 'Best International Group' and the other for 'Best International Album'; their album is entitled The Suburbs.\nDermot O'Leary presented an award to British pop group Take That for 'Best British Group', the first time the group have ever achieved such an award. While the group received the award, member Mark Owen looked at Robbie Williams, who had recently rejoined Take That, and said: \"Can I say thanks for coming back mate. Appreciate it. It's a real pleasure for the five of us to be up here.\" The group had a second nomination for 'Best British Album' but were unsuccessful in winning the award.\nCee Lo Green, a member of the group Gnarls Barkley, received one BRIT Award for 'Best International Male'. In his acceptance speech, he commented: \"I'm so excited. Thank you so much for this honour. Such a pleasant surprise.\" Cee Lo was also nominated for 'Best International Album' but failed to achieve the award.\nRoger Daltrey, lead singer of English rock group The Who, humourously commented that \"[i]t's good to see the British music industry still has enough money for a good booze up\" before giving the award for 'Best British Album' to Mumford & Sons for their album, entitled Sigh No More. Marcus Mumford, of the group, said that \"[t]his is very bizarre, very strange. Thank you very much indeed. We are very honoured, very humbled.\"\nMark Ronson and Ellie Goulding awarded the 'Critics' Choice' to English singer-songwriter Jessie J. Backstage, Jessie J - who is currently at number one in the UK Singles Chart with her song Price Tag, featuring American rapper B.o.B - remarked that \"[p]op stands for popular. I want to be a pop icon and take Britain across the world.\"\nPlan B, another British rapper, achieved the award for 'Best British Male'. \"There's a lot of people I could be thanking right now, I wanna thank them all together,\" he said during his acceptance speech. Having expressed thanks to various family members, friends, his record labels and the people he had worked with, he concluded his speech with the line: \"Thank you, everybody. That's all.\" \nEarlier in February 2011, Markus Dravs was given the BRIT Award for 'Best British Producer' by Chris Martin, a member of the group Coldplay; Dravs is co-producing a fifth album for the group at present. Dravs was nominated for his work in relation to Arcade Fire album The Suburbs and Mumford & Sons album Sigh No More. \"You could hear it in the lyrics and in the commitment in the demos,\" he commented. \"I really wanted to get involved and see if I could help make the record.\"\nDuring the BRIT Awards programme on Tuesday, Cheryl Cole presented the 'Best International Female', which was won by Rihanna. The Barbadian pop and R&B singer exclaimed during her acceptance speech: \"Britain, I love you! This is so exciting. I want to thank everybody at my label, Mercury [...] all my fans here. You guys are the best! I love you so much. This is...this is big. It doesn't get much bigger than the BRITs, so I love you guys. Thank you so much. This means a lot. I'm the only girl in the world!\"\nThe award for 'Best International Breakthrough Act' was given to Justin Bieber, a Canadian pop music \/ R&B singer. Upon accepting the award, Bieber commented: \"I want to thank all my fans over here. You guys are amazing. I want to thank the label over here\". Laura Marling was subsequently awarded 'Best British Female'. After being presented with the award by Boy George, Marling said: \"Thank you. My name's Laura and there you go, mum. That's for you and thank you very much to Adam and Laura and everyone at Virgin. This is really weird.\"\nShortly after the broadcast of the main programme, performances became available to purchase via iTunes.

He was sued by the tutorial schools Modern Education and King's Glory Education Centre for breach of contract and was sued for $8.87 million and $26 million respectively.\nKarno is a well-known but controversial English tutor who taught under Modern Education and King's Glory who claimed to have 9,000 students at the peak of his career. In his notes he used words which some parents considered coarse, and he reportedly used profanity in class. Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor. He has also been accused previously of copyright infringement, but was not charged. A former student said that he 'used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes, and was just like the students' friend.'\nKarno said that he is not only his family's pillar, but is also a father. He explained that he could not afford to pay for lawyers while fighting alone against a large corporation. He decided to stake his reputation for the sake of his family by applying for bankruptcy. On Wednesday, he signed a contract with Contab Education as the chief English tutor and would continue to provide lessons twice a week. He also urged King's Glory to patch up the monetary quarrels and strive to improve the city's education instead.\nA tutorial school sector worker stated that the application was expected, but feared that the incident will make the students think that one does not have to be responsible for one's own actions. He went on to say that the incident may give the impression that tutors cannot be trusted, and that the image of the tutorial industry may be greatly affected."}

The events are covered by an amnesty from 1977, and it is charged that Garzn abused his powers by opening the investigation.\nGarzn appealed the ruling, claiming that had conducted a legitimate inquiry, as crimes against humanity had been conducted during the war, which were not valid under the amnesty.  A date for his trial has not yet been set; if convicted, Garzn would not serve jail time, but would be suspended for as long as 20 years.\nThe Human Rights Watch was critical of Garzn's suspension; a statement from the group said that \"This is a sad day for the cause of human rights. Garzn was instrumental in delivering justice for victims of atrocities abroad and now he is being punished for trying to do the same at home.\"\nOn Thursday, Garzn requested of the Spanish government to be allowed to serve as a consultant for the International Criminal Court, which offered him the post.

The gunman is numbered among the dead, after taking his own life. Ten people are reported injured during the attack by a man identified as Wellington Menezes Olivera, a 23 year old ex-student from the school.\nThe attack took place just after 8am local time (11:00 GMT) this morning. Television station TV Globo reported that Olivera entered the Tasso da Silveira municipal school, telling officials that he was attending to make a speech to students. He was reportedly carrying at least two revolvers and a significant amount of ammunition.\nWitnesses state that he began to fire at pupils' heads, killing ten girls and one boy. Rio state health secretary, Sergio Cortes, stated that those injured in the attack were taken to local hospitals. At least four were said to be in a \"grave\" condition.\nRio's Police chief, Martha Rocha, said in a press conference that the gunman had no previous criminal history. She stated that he was carrying 2 firearms, although she did not specify what type. During the attack he fired off at least 30 rounds of ammunition. There were approximately 400 people in the school when the attack began, and shortly after the shooting started, two small boys outside the school, one with a gunshot wound, ran almost two city blocks until they found police and alerted them to the incident.\nThe two officers who were made aware ran to the school, and quickly managed to locate the gunman, leading to a shooting match. One officer, Marcio Alves, stated that \"He saw me and aimed a gun at me, I shot him in the legs, he fell down the stairs and then shot himself in the head.\"\nPolice report that Olivera was carrying a \"long and rambling\" letter, confirming his intentions to commit suicide.  \nIn a statement by the Mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, he made it clear that life at the school had become a \"hellish nightmare.\" Authorities closed the school temporarily while they investigate, but Mayor Paes confirmed that the school will reopen.\nThe fate of all the children in the school is not yet known. One eleven year old pupil from the school, Wanderson Barbosa, was interviewed by Associated Press as he sat on the steps of his house. He was in his classroom when the attack started, and he and others in his class thought that other students were fighting, until his teacher told them to get to the floor, because it was gunfire. \n\"I'm so worried,\" Barbosa said to reporters, \"We don't have news of everyone yet.\"\nMeanwhile, Rio's Governor, Sergio Cabral, called the attacker a \"psychopath\", whilst indicating that he does not believe anyone else was involved in the attack, but that investigations into the incident will continue."}

The move will make a group with a market value of US$8 billion. The deal has been negotiated since July 2008.\nUnder the plan, both companies keep their own brands and operations, but will be owned by International Airlines Group, a new holding company.

In February, BA reported a loss of $102.4 million for the final three quarters of 2009, whilst Iberia posted an operating loss of $629 million.\nMeanwhile, investors in BA will receive an IAG share for every BA share they own, and stockholders in Iberia 1.0205 shares for each share in the Spanish airline; thus, BA shareholders will take 55% of IAG.\n\"The merged company will provide customers with a larger combined network,\" commented BA chief executive Willie Walsh. \"It will also have greater potential for further growth by optimising the dual hubs of London and Madrid and providing continued investment in new products and services.\"\nMeanwhile, Iberia chief executive Antonio Vzquez remarked: \"This is an important step in creating one of the world's leading global airlines that will be better equipped to compete with other major airlines and participate in future industry consolidation.\"\nIndependent aviation specialist James Halstead said he believed the merger was necessary for BA to remain competitive amongst other European air carriers. \"BA's unique position at Heathrow could help it survive for a short while, but in the long run it needs more than just Heathrow.

{"instructions":"File:PolanskiIFFKV.jpg\n\nOn Monday, Swiss authorities refused a request from the U.S. to extradite Polish film director Roman","gold_ref":"File:PolanskiIFFKV.jpg\n\nOn Monday, Swiss authorities refused a request from the U.S. to extradite Polish film director Roman Polanski, who has been under house arrest in his chalet in Switzerland since December 2009, on charges stemming from the 1977 accusation that he had sex with an American thirteen-year-old girl, Samantha Geimer, in Los Angeles, California. Though the film director pled guilty to rape and unlawful sexual intercourse, he fled to France before he could be sentenced. \nA top U.S. Justice Department official, Lanny Breuer, has said that he is \"deeply disappointed\" with the Swiss decision, and that the U.S. request that Polanski be sent to the United States was completely supported by treaty, facts and the law. Also, U.S. State Department spokesman  P.J. Crowley said \"The rape of a 13-year-old girl by an adult who should know better, and that does know better, is a crime. We will continue to seek justice in this case, and we will evaluate our options.\"\nBreuer also stated that the U.S. government will review its options. However, Switzerland has said no appeal to its decision was possible. Polanski was arrested last September by Swiss police when he arrived in Zurich to receive a lifetime career award at a film festival. The Swiss were acting on a request from the U.S. government.\nThe Swiss Justice Ministry based its decision on the fact that it was unable to determine whether Polanski had already served the full sentence for his crime. This was due to the Los Angeles Superior Court in May ruling that the records of the closed-door 1977 hearings had to remain secret. The Swiss Justice Ministry said U.S. officials should have backed up their request by providing confidential testimony about Polanski's 1977 sentencing procedure in Los Angeles. In past hearings, Polanski's lawyers argued that there were irregularities in the original handling of the case, and U.S. judge Peter Espinoza agreed there was misconduct by the original judge."}

The policy has been the","gold_ref":"The controversial plan to raise university tuition fees in England and Wales will be voted on in the House of Commons on Thursday, December 9. The policy has been the cause of protests across the United Kingdom by students, some of which have turned violent. It has also been a source of considerable criticism and political difficulties for the Liberal Democrats and has raised questions as to the long-term viability of the Coalition government.\nThe new policy on tuition fees will allow universities to double the current tuition fees from 3,290 per year to around 6,000 per year, as well as allowing some universities to get special approval from the Office For Fair Access (OFFA) to raise their fees to 9,000 per year. If passed, the new fee structure will apply starting in the academic year of 2012\/2013. The vote on Thursday will only be on the fee rise, with other matters being voted on in the new year following publication of a new higher education white paper.\nIn addition to increasing fees, the policy will increase the payment threshold at which payment is made. It is currently set at 15,000 and will rise to 21,000, but the interest rate will also rise. It is currently 1.5% but will now vary from between 0% and 3% plus inflation (using the Retail Price Index).\nThe fee increase follows the publication of an independent review by Lord Browne, former chief executive of BP, a process started by Peter Mandelson, the former Business Secretary. Before the election, two main options were mooted for funding reform in higher education: either an increase in tuition fees or a graduate tax. The Browne Review endorsed the former and the findings of the Review form the basis of the government's policy. The graduate tax was supported by the Liberal Democrats before the election, and in the Labour leadership elections it was supported by Ed Balls and the winner of the leadership election, Ed Milliband.\nConservative members of the Coalition intend to vote for the reform, and the Labour opposition have been vociferous critics of the rise in fees, despite the previous government's introduction of top-up fees. The Liberal Democratic members of the Coalition have been left in a politically difficult position regarding the fee hike and have been target of much criticism from protesters. Liberal Democrats have opposed the rise in tuition fees: their party manifesto included a commitment to ending tuition fees within six years, and many signed a pledge organised by the National Union of Students to not vote for any increase in tuition fees.\nThe Coalition agreement allows Liberal Democrats to opt to abstain on votes for a number of policies including tuition fees. Many Liberal Democrats are expected to abstain, and a few MPs have stated that they will vote against it including former party leader Sir Menzies Campbell, and the recently elected party president Tim Farron, as well as a number of Liberal Democrat back-benchers. Liberal Democrat party leaders have said that they will act collectively, but the BBC have said senior Liberal Democrats have admitted in private that government whips will not be able to force all Liberal Democrats to vote for the policy.\nOn Tuesday, the Liberal Democrats parliamentary party will meet in the Commons to decide on their collective position. If all ministers decide to vote for the policy, it will probably pass, but if only cabinet ministers (and maybe parliamentary private secretaries) vote for the policy, there is considerable risk of it not passing. If the Coalition does not manage to get the policy through Parliament, it will fuel doubts about the continued effectiveness and viability of the government.\nHow deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and business secretary Vince Cable vote has been of considerable controversy. Although under the Coalition agreement, they are allowed to abstain, suggestions of doing so have prompted criticism. It was suggested last week that Cable may abstain even though as business secretary he is directly responsible for higher education policy, and has been heavily involved in designing the proposals. Cable has said that Liberal Democrat support of the tuition fee changes has allowed them to push it in a more \"progressive\" direction.\nCable has now decided that he will vote for the policy, and argues that the policy has \"a lot of protection for students from low income backgrounds and graduates who have a low income or take time out for family\". He also believes \"there's common consensus that the system we've devised is a progressive one\".\n\"Dr Cable has performed so many U-turns over the issue of university funding that he is spinning on his heels,\" said National Union of Students president Aaron Porter. \"That may stand him in good stead with the Strictly Come Dancing judges but the electorate will see it differently.\"\nFormer deputy prime minister John Prescott joked on Twitter that \"On tuition fees we've noticed Vince Cable's remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from stalling to Mr In Between\"a reference to a previous attack Prescott made on Gordon Brown as having transformed from \"Stalin to Mr Bean\".\nOn Question Time this week, Liberal Democrat treasury secretary Danny Alexander also confirmed he is prepared to vote for the policy but delegated the question to the meeting of Liberal Democrats on Tuesday.\nThe politics of the tuition fee debate may also affect the by-election taking place in Oldham East and Saddleworth following the removal of Phil Woolas, where Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates will both be standing for the first by-election following the formation of the Coalition government.\nOpposition to the policy has become the focus for a large number of protests across the country by both current university students, many school pupils and political allies of the student movement.\nOn November 10, between 30,000 and 52,000 protesters from across Britain marched through central London in a demonstration organised by the National Union of Students and the University and College Union, which represents teachers and lecturers in further and higher education. At the November 10 protest, a number of people occupied Millbank Tower, an office block which houses the Conservative Party. Fifty people were arrested and fourteen were injured. NUS president Aaron Porter condemned the attack and said it was caused by \"those who are here to cause trouble\", and that the actions of a \"minority of idiots\" shouldn't \"undermine 50,000 who came to make a peaceful protest\".\nFollowing the November 10 march, other protests have taken place across the country including an occupation at the University of Manchester, a sit-in at the John Owens Building in Manchester, and a demonstration at the University of Cambridge. A protest was also run outside the offices of The Guardian where Nick Cleggwho was giving a lecture inside the buildingwas executed in effigy while students protested \"Nick Clegg, shame on you, shame on you for turning blue\" (blue is the colour of the Conservative Party).\nOn November 24, a large number of protests took place across the country including a mass walk-out from universities and schools organised on Facebook, numerous university occupations, and demonstrations in Manchester, Cambridge, Birmingham, Leeds, Brighton and Cardiff, and a well-publicised occupation of University College London.\nIn London, a protest was planned to march down Whitehall to Parliament, but police held protesters in Trafalgar Square until they eventually broke free and ran around in a game of \"cat and mouse\" along the side streets around Charing Cross Road, Covent Garden and Picadilly Circus.\nSimon Hardy from the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts described the police response including the controversial 'kettling' of protesters as \"absolutely outrageous\". Green MP Caroline Lucas raised the police response including the use of kettling in the House of Commons and stated that it was \"neither proportionate, nor, indeed, effective\".\nOn November 30, protests continued in London culminating in 146 arrests of protesters in Trafalgar Square, and protests in Cardiff, Cambridge, Newcastle, Bath, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Belfast, Brighton, Manchester and Bristol. Protesters in Sheffield attempted to invade and occupy Nick Clegg's constituency office. Occupations of university buildings started or continued at University College London, Newcastle University, Cambridge University and Nottingham University, as well as council buildings in Oxford and Birmingham.\nA \"day of action\" is being planned on December 8, the day before the Commons vote, by the National Union of Students."}

The tsunami killed nearly 200 people in American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga. \nThe report, written by the National Research Council, describes the length of time between the earthquake and the initial tsunami warning being issued as \"relatively long\", and states that the standard time for such a warning to be issued to be around two minutes. The study also revealed that one third of tsunami sensors are not working at any given time.\nJohn Orcutt, a [seismologist and head of the committee that wrote the report, described the delay as a \"major concern\", but he also said that \"a large number of people\" in American Samoa \"didn't understand and there were lives that were lost because people simply didn't take the action to get away from the shore when they felt this huge earthquake. People have to understand the signs of a tsunami and head to higher ground.\" \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities, and the Government of American Samoa did not respond to e-mails regarding the news.\nThe study also notes that people living in other coastal cities around the world are at risk of being unprepared for tsunamis that arrive soon after the earthquake occurs, stating that in many places, warnings might not be issued in time. \"If the source were so close to shore that only minutes were available before the tsunami reached the coast, the public would need to recognize natural [signs of a tsunami approaching].\" The report states that when they fear a tsunami is imminent, people should know to evacuate even \"without official warnings.\"\nThe report warns that because tsunamis are so rare, people living near the coast do not know what to do, but it also criticises authorities for not informing citizens of how to react when a tsunami is approaching. \"Everybody thought that the tsunami was a single wave, and once the expected landfall time came and left, they thought it was over,\" said Costas Synolakis, who is director of the \nTsunami Research Center at the University of Southern California, and one of the report's authors. He continued, \"In fact, tsunamis are a series of waves that can last for three to four hours.\" \nHe said that the United States must take action, training first responders in low-lying coastal areas, and adding more tsunami sensors to give advance warning of approaching waves. Synolakis added that, after receiving warning that there may have been a tsunami on the way after the Chile earthquake earlier this year, the response of firefighters at the Port of Los Angeles was poor because they were unfamiliar with how to deal with such a threat.\nIn the capital of American Samoa, Pago Pago, the tsunami measured 1.57 meters in height. The superintendent of the National Park of American Samoa Mike Reynolds reported four waves as high as six meters. People who experienced the quake said it was long, lasting from 90 seconds to three minutes. \"Pago Pago city streets were strewn with overturned vehicles, cars, and debris. Some buildings located only slightly above sea level were completely destroyed by the waves, and power in some locations is not expected to be restored for up to a month,\" Wikinews reported at the time. \nDidi Afuafi, 28, who was riding on a bus in American Samoa when the tsunami struck, described her experiences. \"I was scared.

Authorities fear that the ash can cause vital aircraft parts, such as the engines, to fail in-flight.\nThree large airlines  KLM, Air France, and Lufthansa  have already made test flights.  Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, the head of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), commented: \"Verification flights undertaken by several of our airlines have revealed no irregularities at all; this confirms our requirement that other options should be deployed to determine genuine risk.\"\nKLM, meanwhile, said that it will allow three freight planes to make flights to Asia, and had transferred seven passenger planes from Duesseldorf, Germany to Amsterdam, without any travellers.\n\"We observed no irregularities either during the flight or during the initial inspection on the ground.

El","gold_ref":"Yesterday's release of more US diplomatic cables by Wikileaks covered pressure on governments, Spain's judiciary, and buying foreign assistance with detentions at Guantanamo Bay. El Pais, one of five mainstream papers partnering with Wikileaks' release of documents, examined key output from Madrid's US embassy.\nThe latest cables focus on USSpain relations, particularly during the George W. Bush presidency, with Eduardo Aguirre serving as ambassador in Madrid. He is cited as having \"personally exerted\" pressure on Spain's government and judiciary; this leading to at least three investigations being dropped.\nOf concern to the press is the death of Jos Couso in 2003. The Spanish cameraman was killed during the battle for Baghdad; the Spanish judiciary intended to prosecute three US servicemen over the fatality.\nAmerican use of Spanish air bases for 'extraordinary rendition' was a second concern the US embassy in Madrid pressured the government on. Spanish prosecutors had been keen to pursue 13 CIA officers over the illegal flights.\nRepeatedly, concern over Spain's independent judiciary invoking 'universal jurisdiction' appears in leaked cables. Reports at the time showed magistrates considered actions at Guantanamo Bay torture, and seemed keen to pursue ex-US government officials on grounds of \"criminal responsibility\".\nCable 06MADRID1914 highlights the cases of Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed and Moroccan Lahcen Ikassrien; respectively transferred from Guantanamo Bay, to Spanish custody, in February 2004 and July 2005.\nDescribing conditions at the Cuban detention centre as \"impossible to explain, much less justify\", Hamed  better known as the \"Spanish Taliban\"  saw a July 2006 ruling by the country's Supreme Court annul his six-year prison sentence, granting him an immediate release. The ruling cast doubt on the reliability of evidence against Lahcen, who was released on bail.\nHamed and his family, at the time, announced their intent to sue the US government over his suffering in Guantanamo Bay.\nLater cables illustrate how concerned the Bush administration were over possible prosecution by Baltasar Garzn. Citing an op-ed he penned for a Spanish paper in March 2007, and this subsequently being picked up by Socialist Party secretary Jos Blanco Lopz. Pronouncements by the two, and others, on \"criminal responsibility\" were met with a diplomatically stern response; cable 07MADRID546 states that the government of Spain was \"cautioned that continued statements on this issue by senior Spanish figures would be viewed negatively.\"\nGarzn, best-known for indicting former dictator Augusto Pinochet, seemed to still trouble US diplomats when planning high-level defence talks in March 2007. Mention is made to a possible investigation, and indictment of, Donald Rumsfeld. Spain had informed the US embassy in Madrid the judge in the case was working to dismiss it.\nAs recently as March last year, Garzn sought to prosecute officials from the Bush administration.\nNamed as potential defendants in a Reuters report, John Ashcroft, John Yoo, William Haynes II, Jay Bybee, and, aide to Vice-President Dick Cheney, David Addington were all being investigated by Garzn.\nCome April this year, Garzn himself faced prosecution. A probe into Franco-era war crimes saw him suspended, possibly to be tried for acting contrary to an amnesty extended to Franco supporters. It is alleged he \"acted without jurisdiction\".\nAt present, the former Spanish Supreme Court judge is working at the International Criminal Court. Reports based on El Pais' investigation around the leaked cables suggest the country's judiciary has been politicised to suit American interests.\nWith a price of US$85,000 cited for each former Guantanamo Bay detainee that Spain was to take, recent reports assert other countries have been offered financial incentives to help empty the camp.\nBelgium, alongside Spain, was supposedly offered more influence within the European Union in exchange for cooperating with US plans.\nKuwait's interior minister is said to have refused to take any of their citizens from the camp. Describing inmates as \"rotten\", DPA alleges he told the US to \"get rid of\" detainees in an Afghan war zone.\nYemen, in exchange for agreeing to take Guantanamo detainees, is said to have asked for US$11 million for the construction of a centre to rehabilitate Muslim extremists.\nSo far, only a tiny fraction of the documents in Wikileaks possession have been made public."}

The plot has caused the largest number of complaints to be made about the show since it was first broadcast in 1985.\nCampaigners attempting to raise awareness of SIDS criticised the plot. Anne Diamond, a television presenter and one of those campaigners, remarked that the exchange of the babies was a \"crass twist to an otherwise credible storyline\" and said that not \"one iota of good in educating a young audience about cot death\" had been achieved by it.\nDue to the complaints received, the BBC have made the decision to end this storyline earlier than originally scheduled, during the spring of 2011. Bryan Kirkwood, the current executive producer of EastEnders, has disclosed that, at the end of this storyline, the baby, named Tommy, will remeet Kat Moon, his mother. \nKirkwood said that this storyline, like many others in the BBC One programme, approaches \"social issues in a powerful and dramatic way\". He also explained: \"Although we have had complaints we have also had positive responses from people who have been through the experiences we are currently dramatising who feel we've done this and have contacted us to offer their backing.\n\"Whenever we embark on a story at EastEnders we always leave it open-ended to monitor and listen to audience reaction,\" he continued. \"With this in mind we are going to bring the story to a close on screen in the spring. As the story progresses and Kat is reunited with her child, we hope to explore the impact of the tragic events that have befallen the characters in a way that is powerful, but true to the best public service tradition of the show.\"\nJustine Roberts, the chief executive officer and founder of British community website Mumsnet, created a letter of complaint for Mark Thompson, Director-General of the BBC. \"The focus of the complaint is the swapping story line,\" the letter reads. \"Our members are concerned that, as is all too common, a bereaved mother has been portrayed as deranged and unhinged.\" \nIn response to the Mumsnet letter, Jana Bennett, director of vision at the BBC, stated that this plot was managed in a manner that was \"sensitively handled\". She stressed that \"[t]he show is absolutely not suggesting that this behaviour is typical of a mother who has suffered such a terrible and tragic loss.\n\"Taking Kat's baby is the action of a character in great distress due to a series of events that have befallen her in the last 18 months,\" Bennett explained. \"It is the culmination of these that has driven her to this one moment of madness rather than as a direct result of the loss of her baby. The issues of grief caused by the loss of a child and sudden infant death syndrome more generally are sensitively handled. EastEnders has a long history of tackling difficult issues in a way that allows viewers to learn and debate the topic at hand.\"\nOn Thursday, Samantha Womack denied that this storyline was the reason for her leaving the programme. She has mentioned that her departure had already been arranged with producers of the programme for a few months.\nBefore this incident occurred, the record for the highest number of complaints for EastEnders was a storyline in April 2009 that involved Danielle Jones being killed as the result of a car collision. That storyline received in excess of 7,000 complaints."}

In his statement to the House of Commons, the Chancellor claimed that the Labour government had made the right calls in countering the global recession, but warned that introducing cuts too early would jeopardise the recovery.\nOpposition leader David Cameron attacked the Budget, saying that the headline stamp duty plans were stolen from his own Conservative party. He criticised the amount of government debt, expected to be 167 billion this year, pointing out that it was more than every previous Labour government's borrowing added together. Cameron continued his call for spending cuts to decrease the deficit, saying it was time for a \"radical change of direction\". Darling however maintains that it is too soon.\n\"I know there are some demanding immediate cuts to public spending,\" said the Chancellor to the Commons. \"I believe such a policy would be both wrong and dangerous. To start cutting now risks derailing the recovery  which is already bringing down borrowing more rapidly than expected.\" This year's expected government debt is less than the 178 billion that was forecast in December 2009's pre-Budget report.\nThere will be an estimated 2.2% real terms rise in government spending this year, and several spending announcements were made. However Darling warned that cuts will follow after 2011, and could be \"the toughest for decades\". The Conservatives have said that if they win the upcoming election, they will introduce an \"emergency Budget\" less than 50 days after taking office. \nAmong the plans announced by the Chancellor today are a green investment bank to support renewable energy and low-carbon industries. This will have 2 billion, half raised by sale of government assets, including the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, and half raised from private investment. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds will also have to provide loans worth 94 billion to businesses, with small and medium sized companies receiving at least half of this.

John Adams. \"It was bad information, a miscommunication.\"\nAdams added, \"We have the Tulsa State Fair coming up, and we wanted to let parents know about potential dangers.\"\nThis report gave credence to the rapidly-spreading story of the menacing Pedobear, a satirical cartoon bear that has come to represent paedophilia on the Internet. According to some law enforcement agencies, Pedobear is being used by paedophiles to indicate their sexual interests to one another. They also assert that paedophiles may be dressing up as cute mascots, as a way to get close to children.\nThese assertions have been widely ridiculed on the Internet. The Huffington Post wrote, \"He isn't, in any way, a mascot or supporter for pedophilia.\"  The Internet meme originated on the website 4chan, where it was used to mock overly sexualized images of children. Often, an image of Pedobear was added to the offending posting, with the message, \"Pedobear approves of this post.\"\nFrom there, the meme moved out onto the wider Internet, where it has been repeatedly used as a shorthand way of saying that people were being inappropriate about children. During the Roman Catholic Church's sex scandal, Pedobear was often used to mock the church. A Polish newspaper mistakenly ran an image of Pedobear alongside the 2010 Vancouver Olympics mascots, much to the delight of Internet jokesters.\nPolice in California misunderstood the meaning of Pedobear, and the San Luis Obispo Sheriff's Department began warning parents in public information fliers that Pedobear was an indication of paedophiles nearby. The story  has become an Internet-wide sensation over the past few days, as in-the-know bloggers and reporters began to mercilessly ridicule the police department's actions in the name of protecting children.\nIt \"made them the laughing stock of the internet,\" reported UK tabloid The Daily Mail on Monday. \nDespite the overwhelming scorn heaped on the California law enforcement agencies on the Internet, the Tulsa, Oklahoma police department took the warning seriously, reissuing the public information warning, and mistakenly telling reporters that San Diego Comic Con Pedobear costume was being worn by a convicted \"sex offender.\"\nThe Tulsa Police Department and FOX News 23 have since issued retractions, but the warnings to watch out for Pedobear continue on other Tulsa-area media outlets."}

Jack Mogale","gold_ref":"A judge in South Africa has convicted a serial killer of 52 crimes, including nineteen rapes, sixteen murders, an attempted murder and nine kidnappings. Jack Mogale was convicted before Johannesburg High Court on Wednesday of being what police had dubbed the West End Serial Killer. He was today sentenced to twenty concurrent life terms.\nMogale's crimes lasted a year from March 2008 to March 2009, coming to an end when police were passed his car's number plate information following a teen's disappearance. He was arrested shortly after the killing of a prostitute he had hired; he was found to have a phone stolen from another victim when he was detained.\nWhilst the killer was still at-large police named him after the West-End factory, a building materials factory in Waterworks, Westonaria around which most of the attacks were centred. Other victims were attacked in Lenasia.\nJudge Frans Kgomo also chose to convict Mogale, who is in his forties, of three aggravated robberies, sexual assault, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, theft or fraud and escaping lawful custody. He cleared the defendant, who took victims to open areas before comitting sexual murders, of nine other charges.\n41 witnesses testified for the prosecution, including the only two women to survive. Both told the court he had introduced himself as a Zionist Christian preacher and prophet. He wore a Christian Zion badge and sangoma beads, which both victims identified; identity parades were also submitted as evidence. The accused's distinctive facial scar was recognised by the survivors.\nThe first described his help for a uterine ailment; she said he claimed he needed to have sex with her to exorcise a spirit from her and placed herbs in her vagina, but Mogale countered that they had consensual intercourse as part of an affair. The second said he took her to a veld and attacked her after giving her a lift, knocking her unconscious. Upon awakening the following day she said she had maggot-infested wounds and a dislocated jaw. Her genitals and neck were wounded; her front teeth were missing.\nMost of the bodies were badly decomposed when they were found. They had mostly been killed by blunt force to the skull, either with a weapon or hitting their heads against the ground, although some were strangled. Two women were sodomized. DNA and mobile phone records linked him to the crimes. He originally confessed to police.\n\"I want you to help me,\" he told officers after his arrest. \"When I am with a woman I lose control and do not know what to do. I kill all of them when they do not give me what I want.\"\nMogale's defence centred on accusations the witnesses - amongst them his partner, Charlotte Manaka - and police were trying to frame him. He said police took a condom used by he and Manaka to obtain forensic evidence to plant. Manaka directly contradicted this in her testimony, saying they did not use condoms, as well as saying Mogale regularly wore the beads and badge identified by victims. The couple have four children.\nJudge Kgomo noted that \"[t]his defence is very suspicious, especially because the DNA kit was compiled long before the accused was even identified as a suspect and long before he was arrested,\" and that the state witnesses were important to the case. \"The accused was not a very good witness... with his contradictions and new versions... at times he wanted to shift blame onto his defence counsel.\" The judge felt \"he was not telling the whole truth\" and criticised his failure to produce witnesses to back up his claims.\nProfessor Gerard Labuschagne, who does investigative psychology for the police, was an important witness. He told the court similarities between the various attacks meant they were \"undoubtedly by the same offender.\" Some of the bodies remain unidentified.\n\"On the day he was arrested, the accused displayed hatred for women,\" said judge Kgomo. \"He behaved like a psychopath, even showing his manhood to the female police officer. When he met the same policewoman at the station he said, when I come out of here you will be the first person I rape and kill.\" In summary, Kgomo said, \"[t]he state has proved beyond reasonable doubt the accuseds guilt.\"\n\"I didn't do anything,\" protested Mogale shortly before judgement was handed down. \"You know how life is, this is a challenge, I didnt do any of those things. I dont even know those women.\" He has been convicted of rape twice previously.\nAt sentencing today, Judge Kgomo called Mogale an \"evil and perverted murderer and rapist who pose[s] extreme danger to women in society.\" As well as sixteen life terms for the murders, four extra life terms were handed down for raping some women twice. Each of the three aggravated robberies attracted a fifteen-year sentence, each kidnap produced five years, three years for the theft and fraud charge, three for sexual assault, three for escaping custody and five for attempted murder. All the sentences will run concurrently.\n\"Sir, there is no way you can be allowed to be out of prison to come into contact with women,\" Kgomo told Mogale. \"I am removing you permanently from society.\" As Mogale was led away he shouted at the victims' families \"[y]ou are also coming, I pray. I will be out soon.\""}

The bomb exploded in the town of Al Khalis, approximately 50 miles north of the country's capital, Baghdad. The attack comes eleven days after a series of attacks killed over one hundred people in one day. The country is currently experiencing instability as a result of an inconclusive election result in march, which left no power bloc with an overall majority with which to govern. \nThe blast happened outside a busy coffee shop in the early evening, killing 23 and wounding a further 53 immediately, though death toll rose on Friday and currently stands at at least 30. Many buildings suffered severe damage in the attacka local police lieutenant told Reuters: \"The roof of the coffee shop which was full of people also collapsed. We believe there are still people under the debris\".\nIraqi police have launched an investigation into the attack and into how the car managed to get through a security checkpoint. The deputy governor of Diyala Province called for the sacking of police chiefs after the attack, the second in the town in as many months, and referring to the town as a \"disaster zone\".\nThe attacks were apparently aimed at Shia Muslims in the hope of provoking further sectarian violence and a reaction against Sunni Muslims. While violence in Iraq has drastically reduced since its height after to 2003 invasion, there are fears that the recent attacks are a sign that militants are regrouping in the light of the political power vacuum. There is speculation that Al Qaeda in Iraq, believed to be responsible for the most recent violence, have begun targeting more vulnerable towns and cities, away from Baghdad, where security is tighter."}

Cameron has said he will negotiate with the latter party to try and form a coalition to attain more than 325 seats, or half those in the parliament.\nAfter Labour's large losses at the polls yesterday, both in terms of seats and votes, Cameron said Brown has \"lost his mandate to govern\". Clegg, meanwhile, says he thinks the result allows the Conservatives to try to form a government first, contrary to past tradition, under which the incumbent prime minister and his party in a hung parliament try first to form a coalition.\n\"I've said that whichever party gets the most votes and the most seats, if not an absolute majority, has the first right to seek to govern either on its own or by reaching out to other parties, and I stick to that view,\" Clegg said this morning.\n\"It seems this morning that it is the Conservative Party that has more votes and more seats though not an absolute majority. That is why I think it is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest.\"\nClegg described his party's performance as \"disappointing\" during the night, as they had failed to make any significant advances in their target seats. Overall, the general swing varied, with all parties failing to gain many of their targets, and suffering unexpected losses in others.\nPre-empting a statement from Cameron, Brown said at lunchtime in a short statement outside Downing Street that if any negotiations between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats failed, he would be prepared to form an alliance with Nick Clegg, offering \"far-reaching political reform\", in reference to the Liberals' long held position that the UK's first past the post voting system must be reformed into some form of proportional representation system, historically opposed by the Conservatives.\n\"I understand and completely respect the position of Mr. Clegg in stating that he wishes first to make contact with the leader of the Conservative Party,\" he commented, but noting that, \"should the discussions between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg come to nothing [...] I would be prepared to discuss with Mr. Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties.\" He said there is \"substantial common ground\" between his party and the Liberals.\n\"I understand as I know my fellow party leaders do that people do not like the uncertainty or want it to be prolonged. We live, however, in a parliamentary democracy, the outcome has been delivered by the electorate. It is our responsibility now to make it work for the national good,\" Brown said.\nCameron made his position known in a statement delivered in the early afternoon, in which he offered the prospect of both a Lib Dem supported minority Conservative government, or an alliance \"stronger, more stable, more collaborative government than that\". Cameron stated: \"I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems  the debt crisis, our deep social problems, and our broken political system.\"\nHe went on to describe how both parties had \"common ground\" they could work together on to form a government in the \"national interest\". On the issue of electoral reform, Cameron ruled out holding a referendum, but suggested forming an all party commission on electoral and voting reform. He also ruled out concessions on other Lib Dem positions like greater integration with the European Union or altering the position on defence and the nuclear deterrent, although offering to adopt other Lib Dem policies, such as on schools.\nThe AFP news agency says this is the first time the Liberal Democrats have considered working with Conservatives; previously, the former were thought likelier to negotiate with Labour due to them being considered more \"progressive\". \nBrown, however, has made it clear he has no intention of stepping down as PM, saying he has \"a duty as Prime Minister to take all steps to ensure Britain has a strong, stable and principled government\".\nBusiness Secretary Lord Mandelson commented on the matter, saying: \"The Prime Minister's duty is to stay at his post, to continue doing his job and not resign until it is clear who the Queen should call as an alternative to form a new government, should Mr Brown not be able to do so.\"\nWhen asked whether it was \"inconceivable\" that the PM should step down, Mandelson responded: \"Frankly, there are quite a number of permutations. And the reason I don't want to start getting into hypotheses about what may or may not happen is because, quite frankly, I think it's premature. I am not ruling out or ruling in anything.\"\nUnder British parliamentary convention, in the event of a hung parliament, Brown remains Prime Minister and the Labour Government continues to operate until it is demonstrated it cannot command a majority. The Government effectively gave approval for talks to begin by giving civil servants permission to support all parties in hung parliament negotiations. Brown described how the negotiations could be \"prolonged\", and while recognising people might want a swift conclusion, \"the outcome has been delivered by the electorate. It is our responsibility now to make it work for the national good\"."}

His play had cinched a perfect season for his undefeated Fennville High School basketball team before an exuberant crowd. \nAs Leonard lay motionless on his back, the audience became silent. A witness on the court said Leonard had ceased to breathe and his heart had stopped. Attempts to revive him failed and he was transported to a nearby hospital where he died a little over an hour  later. An autopsy revealed that Leonard had an enlarged heart, causing the cardiac arrest that killed him.\nIt is unclear from media reports whether the school had an automated external defibrillator (AED) available for emergencies, or if the ambulance personnel had employed such equipment.  Also unknown is how much time  elapsed from the moment the player collapsed until the time a defibrillator was employed. Many  schools have acquired defibrillators for such emergencies, according to Michigan High School Athletic Association spokesman John Johnson. He said the devices at schools are not mandated  by law nor by the association's regulations. There is evidence that if, in the first 10 minutes of a cardiac arrest, an  AED is used, up to 80% of the victims can survive. Emergency responders usually need at least seven minutes to arrive on the scene.\nNews media describes Leonards death as shocking the community.  His coach described him as a  healthy and  disciplined athlete who  was the top scorer on his basketball team as well as the quarterback of the school's football team  which won its conference's championship this season.   \nDr. Marc Lahiri, a specialist in disorders of heart rhythm for Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital, said that  detecting underlying heart abnormalities is difficult and such defects  may not become apparent until the occurrence of a sudden and perhaps fatal event. Lahiri said many doctors are encouraging schools to make extensive testing of the heart routine for physicals given to school athletes. Such testing is controversial, not only because of the cost but because of possible false-positives that may lead to the need for additional testing."}

While officials publicly announced that the men would not be brought to the surface until Christmas, sources inside technical meetings have revealed that they could in fact be on the surface by early November. The news comes as families were allowed to speak by radio-telephone to their trapped loved ones on Sunday. Over the weekend, video images filmed by the miners emerged showing the miners playing dominoes at a table and singing the Chilean national anthem. The miners also used the camera to send video messages to their families on the surface, saying that they regularly broke into tears, but were feeling better having received food and water.\nThe grainy nightvision images, filmed on a high definition camcorder that was sent down a small shaft to the mine, show the men in good spirits, chanting \"long live Chile, and long live the miners.\" They are unshaven and stripped to the waist because of the heat underground, and are seen wearing white clinical trousers that have been designed to keep them dry. Giving a guided tour of the area they are occupying, Mario Seplveda, one of the miners, explains they have a \"little cup to brush our teeth\", and a place where they pray each day. \"We have everything organized,\" he tells the camera. Gesturing to the table in the center of the room, he says that \"we meet here every day. We plan, we have assemblies here every day so that all the decisions we make are based on the thoughts of all 33.\" Another unidentified miner asks to rescuers, \"get us out of here soon, please.\" A thermometer is shown in the video, reading 29.5C (85F).\nAs the film continues, it becomes evident that the miners have stuck a poster of a topless woman on the wall. The miners appear shy, and one man puts his hand to his face, presumably dazzled by the light mounted on the cameraman's helmet. One miner sent a message to his family. \"Be calm\", he says. \"We're going to get out of here. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts.\" Another said that the miners are \"sure that there are people here in Chile that are big people, that are powerful people, that are intelligent people, and they have the technology and they will all work together to get us out of here.\" Speaking to the camera, one says: \"we have had the great fortune that trapped in this mine there are good, professional people. We have electricians, we have mechanics, we have machine operators and we will let you know that while you are working to rescue us on the surface, we are down here ready to help you too.\" It has been reported that Mario Gmez, 63, has become the group's \"spiritual leader\", having worked in the mines for over fifty years. He has requested that materials to build a shrine be sent down to the cavern.\nUpon seeing the video in a private screening, family members, who are living in a small village of tents at the entrance to the San Jos copper-gold minewhich they have named Camp Hopewere elated. \"He's skinny, bearded and it was painful to see him with his head hanging down, but I am so happy to see him alive\", said Ruth Contreras, the mother of Carlos Bravo, who is trapped in the mine. The video, of which only a small portion has been released to the public, shows the miners, many of them wearing helmets, cracking jokes and thanking the rescuers for their continued efforts. The supplies are being sent to the men through a small shaft only twelve centimeters wide, and a laboratory has been set up with the purpose of designing collapsible cots and miniature sandwiches, which can be sent down such a narrow space.\nCNN reported on Friday that \"officials are splitting the men into two shifts so one group sleeps while the other works or has leisure time .. On average, each man has lost 22 pounds (10 kilograms) since they became trapped three weeks ago, and dehydration remains a threat. But a survey of the men indicates that at least nine miners are still too overweight to fit through the proposed rescue shaft. Initially, the miners survived by draining water from a water-cooled piece of equipment. To stay hydrated in the 90-degree mine, each miner must drink eight or nine pints of water per day.\"\nBut while there are jubilant celebrations on the surface that the miners are alive, officials are now nervous that the miners could become depressed, trapped in a dark room the size of a small apartment. Chilean health minister Jaime Maalich said that, on the video, he saw the telltale signs of depression. \"They are more isolated, they don't want to be on the screen, they are not eating well\", he said. \"I would say depression is the correct word.\" He said that doctors who had watched the video had observed the men suffering from \"severe dermatological problems.\" Dr. Rodrigo Figueroa, head of the trauma, stress and disaster unit at the Catholic University in Santiago, Chile, explained that \"following the euphoria of being discovered, the normal psychological reaction would be for the men to collapse in a combination of fatigue and stress ... People who are trained for emergencies  like these miners  tend to minimize their own needs or to ignore them. When it is time to ask for help, they don't.\" NASA has advised emergency workers that entertaining the miners would be a good idea. They are to be sent a television system complete with taped football matches. Another dilemma facing Maalich is whether the miners should be permitted to smoke underground. While nicotine gum has been delivered to the miners, sending down cigarettes is a plan that has not been ruled out. \nWith the news that drilling of the main rescue tunnel was expected to begin on Monday, officials have informed the media that they hope to have the miners out of the mine by Christmasbut sources with access to technical meetings have suggested that the miners could actually be rescued by the first week of November. A news report described the rescue plan\"the main focus is a machine that bores straight down to 688m and creates a chimney-type duct that could be used to haul the miners out one by one in a rescue basket. A second drilling operation will attempt to intercept a mining tunnel at a depth of roughly 350m. The miners would then have to make their way through several miles of dark, muddy tunnels and meet the rescue drill at roughly the halfway point of their current depth of 688m.\" Ivn Viveros Aranas, a Chilean policeman working at Camp Hope, told reporters that Chile \"has shown a unity regardless of religion or social class. You see people arriving here just to volunteer, they have no relation at all to these families.\"\nBut over the weekend, The New York Times reported that the \"miners who have astonished the world with their discipline a half-mile underground will have to aid their own escape  clearing 3,000 to 4,000 tons of rock that will fall as the rescue hole is drilled, the engineer in charge of drilling said Sunday ... The work will require about a half-dozen men working in shifts 24 hours a day.\" Andrs Sougarret, a senior engineer involved in operating the drill said that \"the miners are going to have to take out all that material as it falls.\"\nThe families of those trapped were allowed to speak to them by radio-telephone on Sundaya possibility that brought reassurance both the miners and those on the surface. The Intendant of the Atacama Region, Ximena Matas, said that there had been \"moments of great emotion.\" She continued to say that the families \"listened with great interest and they both felt and realized that the men are well. This has been a very important moment, which no doubt strengthens their [the miners'] morale.\" The phone line is thought to be quite temperamental, but it is hoped that soon, those in the mine and those in Camp Hope will be able to talk every day. \"To hear his voice was a balm to my heart ... He is aware that the rescue is not going to happen today, that it will take some time. He asked us to stay calm as everything is going to be OK ... He sounded relaxed and since it was so short I didn't manage to ask anything. Twenty seconds was nothing\", said said Jessica Corts, who spoke to her husband Vctor Zamora, who was not even a miner, but a vehicle mechanic. \"He went in that day because a vehicle had broken down inside the mine ... At first they told us he had been crushed [to death].\" \nEsteban Rojas sent up a letter from inside the mine, proposing to his long-time partner Jessica Yez, 43. While they have officially been married for 25 years, their wedding was a civil servicebut Rojas has now promised to have a church ceremony which is customary in Chile. \"Please keep praying that we get out of this alive. And when I do get out, we will buy a dress and get married,\" the letter read. Yez told a newspaper that she thought he was never going to ask her. \"We have talked about it before, but he never asked me ... He knows that however long it takes, I'll wait for him, because with him I've been through good and bad.\""}

The pair was arrested on Saturday, produced in court on Sunday and have been remanded to police custody till 18 March. Police have seized several maps from them.\nThe men, who are brothers-in-law, have been identified as Abdul Latif Rashid aka Guddu (29) and Riyaz Ali Imtiaz aka Rehan (23), and were arrested in Trombay while allegedly conducting reconnaissance of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) following a tip-off by the Intelligence Bureau (IB), according to police reports.  The Esplanade metropolitan magistrate sent the pair to police custody till March 18 and charged them under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. \nATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi said Adbul and Riyaz had identified three targets in the city; the Thakkar Mall in Borivali (West), the ONGC office and the Mangaldas Market, located at the busy Crawford Market. The suspects had conducted reconnaissance of the Nhava-Sheva area of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in south-east Mumbai, an ATS official said. \"The two were preparing to set one of the ONGC establishments in the city on fire following instructions from someone called 'Uncle',\" an ATS officer said adding \"we are probing if the directions had come from across the border\". \nIB had intercepted suspicious phone calls, between the two suspects and a 'Chacha' (uncle) in Karachi and the ATS had put them under surveillance. They were arrested after the suspicions were confirmed and backed by solid evidence.  Rehan worked as a salesman at the Thakkar Mall, which already had been surveyed by the duo and were awaiting further instructions, according to police. ATS officials did not clarify whether the two were actually going to carry out attacks or were just drawing maps and conducting reconnaissance, being a part of a greater chain of command.\nI have more information about the people arrested, but I will not reveal it at this point as their accomplices, who are still at large, may benefit from it,  said Maharashtra Home Minister R.R. Patil. He refused to tell if there was a connection between these suspects and the Pune blast last month which killed seventeen people. The Home ministry of India described these arrests as significant, saying that the conspiracy was part of the \"Karachi Project\" . \nThe so-called Karachi project was revealed by David Headley, a Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorist arrested in US. It is supposedly a collaboration between Lashkar-e-Toiba and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency involving recruitment of serving and retired Pakistani army officers and fugitive terrorists from India to carry out suicide attacks in India."}

The man immediately notified security, and local police were soon called to the scene. From there, the bag's contents were tested, and the results came back positive for cocaine.\nThe center's director, Robert Cabana, assured the press that neither the Discovery nor the hangar in which it is being housed was compromised by the presence of the illegal drug. He went on to affirm that neither he nor his agency condone the use of any controlled substance by any employee while they are on the job, and that whoever is responsible will be fired and then prosecuted for the offenses. \nFurthermore, Cabana stated that besides probing the criminal nature of what occurred, NASA will also conduct a full review of recent work performed on the Discovery as to make sure that there were not any other potential problems with the shuttle that investigators may have missed the first time.\nAlthough a drug test was performed on each of the facility's over two-hundred workers before they left Wednesday, \"There was nothing obvious,\" said the center's public relations spokesman, Allard Beutel. \nHe goes on to say, \"Nobody was obviously under the influence when they were working, because we have supervisors there, security in there.

Tobacco oil can be very efficiently converted to biofuel, but most oil is located in the seeds, which the plant does not produce many of.\nTobacco seeds produce around 40% oil per dry weight but a crop of the plant yields only around 600kg of seeds per acre.  The leaves have an oil content of around 1.74% oil per dry weight.  The oil has previously been tested for powering diesel-fueled vehicles and can be more efficiently converted than the product of many other crop plants.\nThe team from BFL identified that oil production in the leaves was controlled by two genes: the diacyglycerol acytransferase (DGAT) and the LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2) genes. By genetic engineering, they achieved oil yields of 5.8% oil per dry weight by modifying the DGAT while changes to the LEC2 resulted in a yield of 6.8% per dry weight.\n\"Tobacco is very attractive as a biofuel because the idea is to use plants that aren't used in food production,\" said cancer biology assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson Dr Vyacheslav Andrianov, Ph.D. \"In some instances, the modified plants produced 20-fold more oil in the leaves.\" \nVarious efforts are being made to find biofuel sources that are not also potential food, in order to steer clear of causing further rises in global food costs. Last month the US government anounced funding for research that used nonphotosynthesising micro-organisms to manufacture biodiesel, in the hope that this will prove more efficient than options that rely on photosynthesis. This also escapes one criticism of biofuels like tobacco; that competition for land to grow crops on will result in biofuel crops displacing foodstuffs and pushing food prices up. In November 2009 a Spanish team launched a study to determine if tobacco, as well as the prickly pear, was capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of land not suitable for growing food, selecting these plants for their ability to survive water shortages."}

Severe lightning was also reported.\n\"The female patient was loaded into Lebanon Ambulance One and transported to Frisbie Hospital in Rochester to be stabilized and then was transferred to the trauma center at Maine Medical Center. Her injuries were considered critical and life threatening when she left the scene,\" said Jason Cole, the assistant rescue chief for the area.

Other campers say they had several close calls with tree limbs and debris. At least 12 trees were reported to have toppled during the storm. The family's car was also destroyed when a tree limb landed on it.\nThe National Weather Service in Maine says it will investigate whether or not the storm produced a tornado."}

In tough financial times we need to make sure that our focus is on patient care and every penny is spent in the most efficient way.\" She further said: In the current economic climate, it is impossible to justify huge salaries for consultants and senior executives when health boards are planning 4000 job losses this year, including 1500 nurses and midwives.\"\nBritain's largest health service industrial union, Unison, questioned the amount of money the NHS was paying. A spokesperson said: \"Unison doesnt begrudge anybody the rate of pay for the job but obviously our membership will be concerned that while they are to face a pay freeze and people delivering frontline services are losing their jobs, there is a cohort of folk who appear to earn more than the most senior politician in the land.\""}

According to the authors of the letter, Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak, Toyota dismissed, rather than investigated, the idea that the cars' computers were at fault.  In a statement, James Lentz, the president of Toyota's American division, claimed that hardware issues were to blame, and that dealers were repairing the faulty part.  Toyota also released a study commissioned from the research firm Exponent that said electronic systems were not to blame.  \nAccording to the House committee, however, the study involved only six vehicles, none of which had problems with their electrical systems, and was insufficient to produce an accurate result. \"Our  preliminary assessment is that Toyota  resisted the possibility that electronic defects could cause safety   concerns, relied on a flawed engineering report and made misleading   public statements concerning the adequacy of recent recalls to address   the risk of sudden unintended acceleration.\"\nThe company is under a criminal investigation, and has received two subpoenas for documents from two House committees relating to the recalls, although whether they are directly related to the letter is unclear.  The documents are related to accelerator issues in several models, as well as brake problems with the Prius hybrid car, and were served earlier in in February by a federal grand jury and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Toyota has released upwards of 75,000 pages of documents under the requests.\nIn a separate, though related, development, it has emerged that Toyota last year negotiated a limited recall for two models, the Toyota Camry and Lexus ES, that were affected by the accelerator recalls, saving the company an estimated $100 million.  A confidential internal presentation in July 2009 made the claim, and a month later, a Lexus ES, one of the models under the limited recall crashed in California, killing four people.  The claims apparently referenced a September, 2007 recall of floor mats that could trap gas pedals, the same problem that triggered a full recall of numerous Toyota cars to fix the same problem.  In the same presentation, the company claimed to have avoided recalls of another model related to rust, as well as delaying new federal safety regulations. "}

The proposed rules, issued Friday and expected to be finalized in 2012, would apply to most restaurants, snack bars, vending machines, coffee shops, drive-through restaurants, and convenience and grocery stores.\nThe US Congress required the rules in the health-care reform law  passed in 2010. The  rules proposed by the FDA must undergo a public comment period before they are finalized and take effect, said Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Director for Foods at the FDA.\nThe proposed regulations pertain to businesses devoting more than 50 percent of their floor space to the sale of food or that consider themselves restaurants, specifically food-selling chains with at least 20 stores nationally. Included are candy stores, bakeries, and ice-cream parlors.\nThe FDA's proposed guidelines specify that chains post the calorie counts of foods and drinks on menus and menu boards or next to the food item, such as at a salad bar. The menu is to prominently exhibit the calorie content of each item in a way customers can see easily, giving them the same information packaged foods prepared at home currently provide. The information must be displayed in \"clear and conspicuous\" print and colors.\nMany cities and states have passed laws requiring calorie labeling on menus, beginning with New York City in 2008. California implemented a similar law in January, although many counties are waiting for the release of the federal guidelines before they begin enforcement. Some fast-food chains there, such as McDonald's and Starbucks, are displaying calorie counts on menus in some of their stores. \nThe rules are intended to curb the national obesity epidemic since, according to FDA estimates, one third of the calories people consume yearly come from food eaten out. In a statement issued yesterday, Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services said, \"Giving consumers clear nutritional information makes it easier for them to choose healthier options that can help fight obesity and make us all healthier.\" \nExcluded from the rules are businesses whose primary product is not food sales but that sell it, such as bowling alleys, airports and airplanes, amusement parks, hotels and movie theaters. Alcohol is also excluded."}

He arranged for friend Peter Marsh, 41, to drive the vehicle to his scrapyard in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Marsh then dismantled the vehicle with the intent of disposing of it, but parts were later found wrapped in bubblewrap at Ace Tyre and Exhaust Centre.\nMarsh picked up the TT from outside nearby Gorleston police station. Records show mobile phone conversations between the conspirators that day in March, both before and after the vehicle was reported stolen. The pair denied wrongdoing but were convicted of conspiring to commit insurance fraud after trial.\nThe fraud was uncovered after Hood told former girlfriend Suzanne Coates of the scheme. It was alleged before Norwich Crown Court that he had confessed to her in an effort to resume their relationship. Coates said that after the pseudotheft, Hood told her \"he didn't want to look for it. He said it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack, which I thought was a bit strange.\" \nShortly afterwards Hood suggested they should become a couple once more, she said; she challenged his version of events regarding the car: \"He said he did it but I couldn't tell anyone. He said he did it with Peter. Peter had a key and took the car away and it was going to be taken to bits and got rid of so it was never found.\"\nHood was defended by Michael Clare and Marsh by Richard Potts. Both lawyers told the court that their clients had already suffered as a result of the action in mitigation before sentencing.

His own insurers are refusing to renew their contract with him when it expires and his bank withdrew its overdraft facility. His business employs 21 people and Potts cited Marsh's sponsorship of Great Yarmouth In Bloom as amongst evidence he supported his local community. \nJudge Alasdair Darroch told Marsh that he did accept the man was attempting to help his friend.

He was more critical of Hood:\n\"As a police officer you know the highest possible standards are demanded by the public. You have let down the force.

According to the union, the strike was over reduced flying time for the pilots, triggered by Lufthansa's recent acquisition of several smaller airlines, which the union says is causing traffic to be diverted from union-operated routes. Additionally, the union was seeking a pay increase of 6.4% and guarantees that German labor conditions would apply to Lufthansa crews from abroad, which would reduce the incentive for outsourcing to foreign crews. In a statement issued by Lufthansa, however, the airline said that the union also demanded a greater say in the operation of the airline, which Lufthansa was unwilling to agree to.\nOn Monday, less than 24 hours after it began, the union suspended the strike, agreeing to resume negotiations.

Those who oppose the new law say it limits freedom of speech and freedom of religion, while supporters claim that women are degraded by wearing veils and the law is intended to empower those women, as well as increase public security.\nThe French government, in defense of the ban, said that it was necessary because wearing veils falls short of the living standards in France and and makes women be of an lower status in a country where everybody is considered equal.\nFrench Prime Minister Francois Fillon has said that the ban is consistent with the national values of France. \"The French Republic lives in a bare-headed fashion,\" he said in a statement published by a government newspaper.\nThe French government previously made efforts to accommodate Muslims in the country, including establishing a council dealing with the presence of Islam; however, according to Amer Sahar, a professor who studies the topic, some Muslims in the country say that they feel as though they are under assault by the government. She said that some are \"resentful of the fact that they are not allowed to be both Muslim and French.\"\nThe French government is also concerned with women and children who are forced to veil themselves. It has said that such an action is \"a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil.\" There is a fine of 30,000 euros (about $43,300) and a year in prison for forcing an adult to wear the niqb or burqa. The fine is doubled for forcing a minor to wear the veils.\nActivist Rachid Nekkaz auctioned one of his homes to provide money to pay the fine for any woman arrested under the law. \"I would like to send a clear message to President Nicolas Sarkozy that we can do what we want. We have rules. We have a constitution and everyone has to respect it,\" he said.\nAccording to the French Constitutional Council, the law \"conforms to the Constitution\" because it does not limit the freedom of religion or excessively punish people for exercising that right in a place of worship.

In the cables dating back as early as January 2004, the embassy reports the military activities could include the construction of a nuclear reactor in or near Minbu, along with \"SAM missiles\" and an underground facility with as many as 300 North Korean military personnel assisting the Burmese military in the construction. Burma is primarily controlled by its military.\nIn the January 2004 cable, a businessman reportedly told the U.S. embassy in Rangoon that \"massive\" barges were bringing in large pieces of equipment to  Minbu from the Irawaddy River. He suggested that \"the quantities involved as well as the diameter of the rebar suggested a project larger than 'factories.'\" In the same cable, the U.S. acknowledges that rumors of a nuclear reactor being constructed in the area date back to 2002, with suspected Russian involvement. \"Rumors of ongoing construction of a nuclear reactor are surprisingly consistent and observations of activity such as that described [sic] appear to be increasing,\" said Martinez, the reported cable author. According to a news report in March, The Irrawaddy claims Burma was close to completing at least three nuclear reactors. The country's leadership claims the nuclear research that is taking place is to be used for peaceful purposes.\nIn August of the same year, the U.S embassy receives more information that North Korea military is assisting in the construction of \"SAM missiles (surface to air missiles) of unknown origin\" and an \"underground, concrete reinforced\" facility in Minbu. The construction allegedly includes buildings which would house at least \"20 Burmese army battalions that will be posted near the site.\" The correspondent again says that the report \"tracks with other information Embassy Rangoon and others have reported in various channels.\"\n\"This account is perhaps best considered alongside other information of various origins indicating the Burmese and North Koreans are up to something. Something of a covert military or military-industrial nature. Exactly what, and on what scale, remains to be determined,\" said McMullen, the reported cable author. He also admits that the number of North Koreans thought to be assisting the Burmese military \"is much higher than our best estimates of North Koreans in Burma.\" According to the Agence France-Presse in 2002, citing an unnamed U.S State Department official, the U.S. warned Burma not to pursue a nuclear program saying  that it expects Burma \"to live up to its obligations [under the non-proliferation treaty] and to not pursue production of weapons grade fissile material.\" However a 2008 cable says that Burma may already be in possession of weapons grade uranium. The cable reports that a civilian tried to sell 2,000 kilograms of uranium-238 which \"could be dug up\" from the ground at a site in Kayah State. Uranium-238 could be used in the construction of nuclear weapons.\n\"A Burmese civilian met with members of USDAO [United States Defense Attach Office] Rangoon and offered to sell Uranium-238. The individual had initially contacted the USDAO eight days prior with the offer. The individual provided a small bottle half-filled with metallic powder and a photocopied certificate of testing from a Chinese university dated 1992 as verification of the radioactive nature of the powder,\" said the cable. \"The individual claimed to be able to provide up to 2000 kg of uranium-bearing rock from a location in Kayah State, and further stated if the U.S. was not interested in purchasing the uranium, he and his associates would try to sell it to other countries, beginning with Thailand,\" it added. The cable adds that the Burmese government was unaware that such a transaction was taking place and that they \"would likely seize any additional samples or stocks of the material if aware of their existence.\" However, a cable in January of 2007 says that the Burmese military may have received a shipment of uranium at the end of that month. The \"sensitive shipment\" was said to have come from Singapore via shipping freighter.\n\"[An unnamed witness] claimed that metals are usually exported in blocks, whereas the bags in this shipment were filled with loose earth and mud. The source of the mixed ore, Maw Chi, is also a source for uranium, they claimed. Security was tighter than usual, surveillance was heavier, and officials paid closer attention to the movement of the shipment and activity at the port,\" said the cable. The cable author, 'Villarosa,' later states that the embassy in Rangoon was given allegedly detailed information on the shipping methods, weight and cost. No further cables have yet to be released on the matter."}

The case is thought to be a landmark decision regarding Internet publishing.\nThe case dates back to November 2009, when Ryan Ward was on trial before Sheffield Crown Court, accused of murdering Craig Wass. The prosecution case was that Ward hit Wass with a brick, and no firearms allegation was made against Ward at trial, but both titles placed a photograph on their websites of Ward with a gun.\nThe papers took the image off their sites within hours, after being ordered to do so. The trial judge, His Honour Judge Michael Murphy QC, who had previously ordered the jury not to consult the Internet, did not halt the prosecution as he felt \"satisfied\" the jury hadn't seen the picture. Ward was convicted.\nLawyers for Associated Newspapers and News Group Newspapers  respective owners of The Daily Mail and the The Sun  had argued in their defence that using the photo posed an \"insubstantial\" risk of prejudice, denying contempt although accepting they made \"a mistake\".\nAttorney General Dominic Grieve had described \"seriously impeded or prejudiced\" proceedings had jurors accessed the photos. Angus McCullough QC represented Grieve, telling the court the \"strict liability\" provisions of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 had been breached.\nHigh Court judges Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Owen Thursday sided with Grieve and McCullough: \"We conclude that the nature of the photograph created a substantial risk of prejudicing any juror who saw that photograph against the defendant Ward.\"\nLord Justice Moses' judgment mentioned the significance of the case in regards to online publications: \"The criminal courts have been troubled by the dangers to the integrity and fairness of a criminal trial, where juries can obtain such easy access to the internet and to other forms of instant communication. Once information is published on the Internet, it is difficult if not impossible completely to remove it... This case demonstrates the need to recognise that instant news requires instant and effective protection for the integrity of a criminal trial.\"\nThe Daily Mail's website covered the ruling in an article in which they also offered an explanation for how they published the photograph. \"[A] journalist had submitted an article about the prosecution along with the photograph by e-mail, including a warning stating the handgun should not be included in any copy of the photograph as it would prejudice the trial,\" it reads. \"But when the story was put up online a freelance journalist, then working for the website, added the photograph without taking any legal advice.\"\nThe penalties for Associated Newspapers and News Group Newspapers will be considered by the judges later."}

The F-15E Strike Eagle that they were flying reportedly suffered a mechanical failure on Monday night and crashed. Soon after the accident, a U.S. military helicopter landed in the area to extract the airmen and reportedly opened fire on civilians, wounding six of them.\nUnconfirmed reports indicate the six civilians were taken to a hospital in the area after being fired upon by the helicopter, a V-22 Osprey. One of the wounded, a young boy, was shot in the leg, which will likely now require amputation. Another of those reported injured said the shooting caused \"great panic.\" Wikinews understands the Pentagon is to open an investigation into the rescue mission.\nHowever, a U.S. military spokesperson denied the reports \"one hundred percent\", and said the incident \"didn't happen\". He said the aircraft which rescued the two airman was not fitted with weapons. \"The Osprey is not armed and the Marines barely came off the aircraft,\" he said.\nThe pilot of the fighter aircraft was extracted during the rescue mission, while the weapons officer was found and cared for by Libyan rebels before later being retrieved by American forces. Both crew members suffered only minor injuries, the military said. The fighter aircraft was deployed over Libya in support of the no-fly zone approved by the United Nations Security Council over Libya as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn."}

The CPS would have to back the case up beyond reasonable doubt before a court, but the Met's internal hearing considered only the balance of probabilities.\nThe policeman, whose name was not released as he has not been charged, met the woman  who is in her early twenties  after she became unwell following a night drinking with friends at a hotel party in Russell Square. The officer took her to a nearby pub where he had been drinking; later, he said he got her a glass of water, after which she vomited. CCTV footage showed the pair embrace. They then went to St Pancras railway station, where the officer was to sleep in a police locker room before going on duty that morning.\nShe would later claim to have little recollection of events, but that she awoke to find herself being raped. She told police in March last year, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched an investigation. The accused man stated at interview the sex was consensual. The IPCC's file was passed to the CPS.\nMet Commander Mark Simmons said \"[t]his officer acted in an intolerable way and it is only right that once such dreadful behaviour was found proven the man was dismissed from the Met.\" IPCC Commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said \"[t]he actions of this officer will rightly appal the public as they have appalled me.

The Muslim Ladies College of Australia and its director, Anwar Sayed, were accused of acquiring both federal and state funding in a fraudulent manner to the amount of AU$1.13million (US$1.02million) and the woman was expected to testify regarding it.\nDefence lawyers claim that valuable facial cues could be lost or hidden from the jury if the woman was to wear the Burqa while on the stand.

The statement comes over a month after electric barriers were placed in local canals to block the fish from entering Lake Michigan.\nOriginally from Asia, the carp have infested portions of the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and several Chicago-area waterways. Failing to keep the fish away from the Great Lakes could severely damage the $7 billion fishing industry there.\nTheIllinois Department of Natural Resources, along with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers biologists, placed netting and electric stunning prods in areas where the carp were most likely to gather, about 25 miles away from Lake Michigan. A six-week search since then has resulted in none of the undesirable silver or bighead carp, but rather over 1,000 common carp and other harmless variations.\nThe State of Michigan, along with the Great Lakes States of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York and the Canadian Province of Ontario, has requested an injunction to shut down two Chicago canals leading into lake Michigan. The US Supreme Court has twice rejected that request.\nAlthough no Asian carp has since been found, the Michigan Attorney General still wants the locks closed. \"What did they expect?

According to the airline, a total of 166 people were on board the plane, 160 passengers and six crew. One of the seven survivors said that a tire on the plane had exploded as it was landing and \"[w]ithin three seconds there was a fire blast. The inside was filled with smoke.\"\nThe cause of the crash is not yet known, though pilot error is presumed to be responsible. The pilot of the aircraft, a Serbian with around 10,000 hours of experience, had made no distress call before the crash.  Visibility was also said to be good; the head of India's airport authority said that \"visibility was six kilometres (four miles) when the aircraft approached the runway which was more than sufficient.\"  Light rain was falling at the time of the crash.\nAnother survivor said that there had been no warning before the plane crashed.  \"Immediately on touching the ground, the aircraft jerked and in a few moments hit something.  Then it split in the middle and caught fire. I just jumped from the gap.\"\nAn Air India official said that \"[a]s far as the information available with us is concerned, eight persons were rescued and shifted to local hospitals in Mangalore for treatment.\"  He also said that one of these people, reportedly a seven-year-old boy, had died while being taken to a hospital.  A police official said that around 120 bodies have been recovered so far, some with severe burns.\nRescue workers had difficulty reaching the site of the crashed plane, as the valley is bordered by steep slopes, and heavy smoke hindered their progress.\nThe airport the aircraft had been attempting to land at is considered a challenging one, as it is on a flat plateau bordered by a valley.  A former official from India's aviation ministry said that \"Mangalore is a difficult field because it is on a plateau.  From all accounts the visibility was all right. One cant make any conclusions.\"\nFamilies of the people killed in the crash will be compensated 200,000 Rupees (about $4,260 USD), while families of survivors will be compensated 50,000 rupees (about $1,064 (USD). All of the money will be provided by the government of India.\nThis crash is the first significant crash of a passenger jet in India since July 17, 2000, when 51 people on board a Boeing 737 were killed as it crashed into buildings during an attempt to land at an airport in the city of Patna."}

The launch was viewed by over 40,000 spectators at Kennedy, including a small group chosen by NASA for a space \"tweetup\". Carrying six veteran astronauts and an assortment of parts for the International Space Station (ISS), the shuttle took off without any delays. This mission, scheduled to take twelve days, is the aging shuttle's 32nd voyage into space of its 25-year career.\nWhile no damage to the shuttle was seen, a piece of space junk near the ISS caused minor concern (but no delays). The shuttle is expected to dock at the ISS early Sunday morning, and the crew will perform maintenance work on the ISS next week. If everything proceeds without incident, Atlantis will leave the ISS on May 23 and land on May 26.\nThis flight also marks the third-to-last mission of NASA's Space Shuttle program, which is being retired this year. However, Atlantis will still be maintained as an emergency rescue shuttle for the final Space Shuttle mission, and while NASA could also use Atlantis to resupply the ISS, it has not yet made a final decision regarding the plan."}
