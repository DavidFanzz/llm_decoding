{"document":"In a series of Freedom of Information requests, BBC Scotland asked how many cases, concerns and complaints of child exploitation, and child sexual exploitation were recorded in the past four years.\nBut the force said the figures were not held on a single system.\nScotland's Children's Commissioner said the revelation was \"disturbing\".\nIt comes on the day that officers launched a new unit to help with what police acknowledge is the complex problem of child abuse and neglect across Scotland.\nIt will provide expertise to allow local teams to robustly investigate cases, including child sexual exploitation, online offences and other types of abuse.\nIn its response to the BBC's FOI requests, Police Scotland said: \"Child exploitation covers a broad range of criminal activity and doesn't correlate to a specific offence, but rather can involve a range of differing offences...The level of data you have requested is not held on a single system.\"\nIt comes after the publication last summer of the Jay report into sexual exploitation in Rotherham in South Yorkshire.\nIt revealed that more than 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual abuse.\nLast year Glasgow City Council said 97 children in the city were victims, or at risk of, sexual exploitation.\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers said most forces in England and Wales now put a marker on such offences in their records, but senior officers here say that it is not easy to do.\nChildren's Commissioner Tam Baillie said: \"I am disturbed that we do not yet collect police figures on children who are the subject of sexual exploitation.\n\"This was a recommendation of the Scottish Parliament and features in the Scottish government action plan on child sexual exploitation.\n\"The reason this is so important is that unless we know the scope of the problem we are trying to deal with, then we won't have the appropriate or proportionate response.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham, from Police Scotland, said the nature of child sexual exploitation made it highly unlikely that young people would come forward to report being abused.\n\"Our priority is to be focussing on identifying as many victims as we can and identifying perpetrators who have the intent to commit these devastating crimes so we can prevent the abuse from happening,\" he said.\n\"Scotland is at the forefront of approaches to child sexual exploitation.\n\"Sexual exploitation is a form of abuse and it is not a specific crime type recorded as such. Children and young people may be victim of repeated rapes, physical assaults or grooming offences and we categorise all of these in crime recording.\"\nHe added: \"But what is most important here is our focus on identifying who these victims are.\n\"Our focus is always on where there are child protection issues, and on keeping children safe.\"\nMartin Crewe, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: \"Rotherham was a real wake-up call and led to the Scottish government's national action plan last year but we could and should be doing more.\n\"Our concern is that we don't know the full extent of the problem. We welcome the work of the police.\n\"Since the publication of the Barnardo's Scotland petition in 2011 we have been pushing for a better understanding of child sexual exploitation in Scotland.\"\nIn January 2013, Aileen Campbell, Minister for Children and Young People, responded to the Public Petitions Committee inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland, and announced four points including, action \"to improve the way child sexual exploitation is identified by Scotland's new single police force to make this form of abuse more visible\".\nHowever, sexual exploitation per se is still not recorded or centrally collated.\nThe Scottish government said figures are available on the wider problem of child abuse.\nA spokeswoman said: \"The safety of our children is a key priority for the government and an issue we take extremely seriously.\n\"The launch of the National Child Abuse Investigation Unit will help to target and bring to justice those who seek to harm our young people.\n\"The unit has been set up to tackle all forms of child abuse, and child sexual exploitation is one aspect of this. We have robust legislation in place to cover a wide range of these offences, including online abuse and are working to strengthen the law even further.\"\nShe added: \"The extent of the problem is often difficult to assess because abuse by its very nature is concealed. That's why prevention and swift action to safeguard children are a big part of our strategy to tackle these terrible crimes.\n\"This includes robust National Child Protection guidance, action to tackle emerging forms of child abuse including child sexual exploitation, a national public awareness campaign and guidance for night-time workers such as taxi drivers and hotel staff who may come into contact with those at risk.\"","summary":"Police Scotland has said that it does not collate or hold specific figures on child sexual exploitation.","id":32389328}
{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nAnnemiek van Vleuten doesn't remember the rest: bike cartwheeling into the trees; a roaring silence followed by panicked voices; rivals sweeping past, one by one. That's one way to erase the memory of an Olympic dream crushed.\n\"I remember I had a gap on my competitors and was thinking, 'OK, it's not necessary to go crazy going downhill',\" the 33-year-old Dutchwoman, who was leading the road race in Rio when the crash took place, tells BBC Sport.\n\"Then it started to rain a little bit, so I was actually extra careful. But the corner surprised me and I didn't take it properly. Next thing I remember I was awake in a hospital bed and I had my mother on the phone.\"\nBack in the Netherlands, poor Mrs Van Vleuten had been watching the race on her birthday. The agony these elite athletes put their parents through. Then again, what about us viewers - that wasn't what we were expecting when we switched on the TV expecting some wholesome sporting entertainment.\nAnd what about her poor team-mates - when Anna van der Breggen rounded the bend, she thought Van Vleuten might be dead. This being the Olympics, Van der Breggen didn't think of stopping but rode on to win the gold instead.\nBut this interview didn't take place from said hospital, or even a different one in the Netherlands. Two weeks after the crash that was heard around the world, Van Vleuten was on her bike again. Never mind the three fractures in her back, the severe concussion, the worried mum, there were other races to be won.\n\"The first week I was really struggling with the idea that I was going for gold and made that stupid, stupid mistake. But then I realised that thinking like this was not going to help me feel better. So I started making some new goals.\n\"The three vertebrae were not broken in a dangerous place in my back, only on the side, and I never had serious symptoms of the concussion. And as a cyclist you're used to crashing at least once or twice a year, it's part of the job.\"\nAlmost a month to the day after her Olympic hopes hit the skids, Van Vleuten won her first stage, the Belgium Tour prologue. Three days later, Van Vleuten clinched the overall title with a stirring solo effort on the final stage.\n\"It's sort of a miracle but I sort of expected it,\" said Van der Breggen, apparently a difficult woman to stir. \"She is really tough. That is Annemiek.\"\nA tough talker, too. Asked how she felt when she heard Britain's Lizzie Deignan (nee Armitstead) had been cleared to compete in the Olympic road race, having missed three drug tests in a year, Van Vleuten goes for the jugular.\n\"I was angry about it because the rules are for everyone and you cannot make exceptions. It's part of the job, you have to take it seriously. It's very special to miss three tests in one year, a really big achievement. Maybe because she's the world champion they made an exception for her but I don't think that's fair.\"\nVan Vleuten is similarly outspoken on the subject of inequality in cycling, advocating that every men's race should have a women's equivalent.\n\"What would help is if we had more time on television. That would help to get more sponsors and more people to watch and enjoy it. The [women's] Rio road race was a good example of that, it was at the same level as the men's race.\"\nAt the current rate, equality will arrive in cycling long after Van Vleuten has pedalled her last and hung her bikes up. Female cyclists earn a fraction of what male cyclists pull in and the chance to ride one day of the Tour de France is little more than a patronising pat on the head from the cycling authorities.\nBut just as Van Vleuten doesn't like to look over her shoulder, she doesn't like to look too far forward. It makes a lot of sense, given what happened in Rio.\n\"After the London Olympics I wasn't only thinking of Rio. Cycling has a lot of nice races, like the Tour of Flanders [which Van Vleuten won in 2011 and Armitstead this year], which is a super-beautiful race to win. I just see things one day at a time and year by year.\"\nNext for Van Vleuten is the World Championships in Qatar, which run from this Sunday and in which she will compete alongside Van der Breggen in the team time trial and the road race. Expected to compete against the clock in temperatures pushing 40C, it's good that she can look on the bright side.\n\"It's hard for me to do interviews that always want to talk about the crash because it's something I've accepted and I don't want to look back at that.\n\"I prefer to think about the part before, the part when I was going uphill and riding so excellent, better than I ever did. That part was nice to watch back again. I'm proud of what I did, that day in Rio was really special.\"\nFollow coverage of the World Road Championships from 9-16 October across the BBC.","summary":"If you don't remember the name, let me remind you of the carnage: back wheel rears up, like the hind legs of a bucking bronco; rider performs a half-twisting front flip; rider lands on her shoulders, skids off the road and spins onto her front; rider hangs limp over the kerb, like a rag doll tossed from a car window.","id":37550889}

{"document":"So how did the individual players on each side fare?\nFormer Rangers and Scotland midfielder Stuart McCall assesses the performances of the Ibrox side, while former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner rates Ronny Deila's players.\nWes Foderingham (goalkeeper) 7\nDid OK and kept passing the ball short out of defence, which was the basis of Rangers' approach. Made a really important save from Tom Rogic soon after Celtic had clawed it back to 2-2. That was a huge moment and then he saved from Scott Brown in the shootout.\nJames Tavernier (defender) 7\nEverybody questioned him defensively beforehand, but he answered them all. Only once did he revert to fouling Patrick Roberts and he didn't give Gary Mackay-Steven a sniff when faced with him. Also kept attacking throughout, although it was a tired penalty kick he missed in the shootout.\nRob Kiernan (defender) 7\nShowed great composure at times during the game, bringing the ball down and playing it out of dangerous areas with passing triangles. Didn't play with any fear before his injury and was solid defensively.\nDanny Wilson (defender) 8\nHas improved in recent months and that showed in this game. He took charge at the back and showed maturity and composure throughout. Handled the difficult challenge of facing Griffiths well.\nLee Wallace (defender) 8\nHis energy levels were remarkable. In the first half, he and Barrie McKay were excellent as a pairing. Wallace had to defend well against Roberts, but kept to his strengths and was always bombing forward. Even in extra time he was running beyond McKay to make things happen, and was strong defensively. A consummate pro and played a captain's role.\nAndy Halliday (midfielder) 7\nScott Brown dominated the midfield in last season's Old Firm game, but Halliday stood up to him, got tackles in and got the fans going. He also showed a good range of passing. Set the tone for Rangers early on with his energy and assertiveness and took responsibility by scoring Rangers' opening penalty in the shootout.\nDominic Ball (midfielder) 7\nPlayed in the holding role and was booked in the second half so will miss the final. Stefan Johansen created a couple of openings early on, but Ball was solid and kept the play moving. Looked comfortable when he switched to centre-back after Kiernan was injured.\nJason Holt (midfielder) 7\nNice and bright in possession throughout, and was always looking to link up with the forwards in the final third. Also didn't neglect his defensive duties. His performance was like his season: consistent.\nDean Shiels (forward) 7\nWas asked to play in a position that is not his strongest, wide on the right. Tracked back and performed diligently, while contributing to Rangers' good possession in the first half.\nKenny Miller (forward) 7\nEarly on, his intelligent run beyond Charlie Mulgrew delivered a chance and Craig Gordon had to save well. That's typical Miller, he sniffs out a chance and is always on the move. Took his goal well, tucking it away as he has done all his career. Typically sharp and hard working.\nBarrie McKay (forward) 9\nEven prior to the goal, he was Rangers' best player. Early on, he and Wallace combined well down the left, as Rangers took the game to Celtic. Has quick feet and glides past players. Gave Mikael Lustig a hard game. Always looked after the ball and scored an outstanding goal.\nNicky Law (midfielder) 6\nIt's always difficult to come into a game like this as a substitute. He was also asked to play in an unfamiliar position wide on the right. Will be disappointed to have let Kieran Tierney in to cross for Celtic's equaliser but he atoned in the shootout, with a cool penalty.\nGedion Zelalam (midfielder) 6\nFilled in when Ball had to move into defence and tried to keep play moving. Showed composure in the shootout to score a pressure penalty.\nNicky Clark (forward) 6\nWorked hard and showed good energy when he replaced Miller. Stepped up during the shootout but saw his effort saved\nCraig Gordon (goalkeeper) 7\nDid everything he was asked to do during the game. He didn't have any chance with either of the Rangers goals, but gave Celtic hope in the shootout when he saved Clark's penalty.\nMikael Lustig (defender) 6\nThe Sweden international had a hard time against Barrie McKay, particularly in the first half. He also didn't link up well with Patrick Roberts in front of him, and McKay and Wallace were able to get in a few times.\nDedryck Boyata (defender) 5\nOnly played for 23 minutes before leaving the field with an injury. Still made a couple of mistakes in that time, being caught in possession and having to commit a foul to halt a Rangers attack.\nCharlie Mulgrew (defender) 6\nHe was steady throughout the game at centre-back, and showed his experience. Didn't do anything wrong, and was fine in possession. Stepped up to take a penalty in the shootout.\nKieran Tierney (defender) 8\nClearly Celtic's best player. At times he was up against two Rangers players, but still able to handle both of them very well. Worked up and down the pitch, showed good defensive instincts and still had the legs and the wherewithal to create the equaliser late on in extra time with a great cross for Tom Rogic.\nScott Brown (midfielder) 7\nAnother steady performer for Celtic. At the start of the second half, when Celtic needed to up the tempo, he pushed further forward and helped to haul his side back into the game. He did what was asked of him.\nNir Bitton (midfielder) 6\nIn extra time he was signalling that he had a hamstring injury and needed to come off. But he stayed on the pitch, kept playing on and then stepped up to take a spot-kick. For all his ability, though, he was still too quiet at times.\nGary Mackay-Steven (forward) 5\nCouldn't really get into the game. Celtic did not use him that much, but in that case he then has to go looking for the ball, and demand to receive it. The game passed him by.\nStefan Johansen (midfielder) 5\nDidn't deliver enough on the day. With his talent, he should have been more influential, but that's been the story of this season for the Norwegian international.\nPatrick Roberts (forward) 6\nShould have equalised in the first half when faced with an open goal and had another scoring opportunity in the second half on his right foot, so missed big chances. Great delivery for the corner kick that Erik Sviatchenko scored from, but he tired late on.\nLeigh Griffiths (forward) 6\nNot one of his better games, looked jaded and could have worked the Rangers centre-backs more. He didn't get the right supply, but still managed to hit the post and then the bar late on with a magnificent free-kick which could have won the game.\nErik Sviatchenko (defender) 7\nScored a powerful header and had two more on target. Did OK defensively and shored Celtic up; his partnership alongside Mulgrew looked stronger.\nCallum McGregor (midfielder) 6\nWas busy when he came on, without influencing the outcome of the game. Also missed one of the spot kicks.\nTom Rogic (midfielder) 7\nScored a great goal and made things happen when he came on. Had more of an impact than the other substitutes, but missed the critical spot-kick and that will haunt him.","summary":"Rangers are through to their second cup final of the season after beating Celtic 5-4 on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time.","id":36067504}

Communities which develop a flood plan can act more quickly and effectively when flooding happens.\n\"It is vital that services comes together and work hard to save lives, protect property and help communities recover,\" said Mr Sargeant.\n\"This was demonstrated in serious flood incidents last year and we owe our emergency services a debt of gratitude for their professionalism, commitment and dedication.\"","summary":"A summit is considering how Wales can respond to the growing threat posed by flooding.","id":21648426}

He is always judging the right time to consolidate and the right time to seize a game by the scruff of the neck.\nThe sheer volume of his runs leaves no room for debate: Virat has scored 8,008 runs in 183 one-day internationals, at an average of 54.47, and this week moved to the top of the ICC rankings of ODI batsmen.\nHe has found his best form in this tournament, scoring an unbeaten 81 in India's opening win over Pakistan, adding an unbeaten 76 in the do-or-die victory over South Africa, and compiling a clinical and commanding 96 not out in the semi-final victory over Bangladesh.\nIndia's batting order is decorated with many brilliant talents, but the Pakistan bowlers will realise the paramount importance of controlling Virat on Sunday.\nHe has been blessed with wonderful natural talent but, as ever among high achievers, his talent is underpinned by a willingness to work hard.\nUnseen, he is determined and relentless in training, remaining in the nets as long as necessary to ensure he feels comfortable with every aspect of his game. I have watched him rehearse his strokes over and over again, until sweat is pouring from his brow, never stopping until he is satisfied.\nBeyond the golden talent and the iron determination, Virat has learned how to cope with the pressures of his exalted position.\nIf you drive into almost any city in India, you will see his face appear on every other billboard. Being the most marketable and possibly the most popular personality in a nation of 1.3bn people brings its own pressures: he simply cannot move without being begged for a 'selfie' and his every move, word and even gesture is relentlessly reported in print, electronic and social media.\nTwitter whirred when he stuck out his tongue to celebrate a wicket against Bangladesh.\nVirat has learned to live with these realities... and also to accept the burden of unrealistic expectation that he should score runs every time he reaches the crease, and that his team should win every time they take the field.\nWhen things don't go well - and, unfortunately, for Virat as for anyone else, things don't always go well - he falls back on his intense commitment and works ever harder until he turns the corner and meets the excessively high expectations.\nThere were occasions earlier in his career when his determination to succeed spilled over into outbursts anger and volatility on the field, but such incidents are rare now. He has evolved into the very model of a calm, clinical and confident professional cricketer, seemingly in control of every situation.\nIntense and serious in matches and at practice, he retains the invaluable ability to switch off from the game, relaxing, laughing and joking at every opportunity.\nHe enjoys calling people by playful nicknames and he can find humour in almost every situation, even when we are spending hour after hour at another photo shoot, waiting for the photographer to be ready, then being told how and where to pose, then waiting some more, then being told we have to start the process all over again.\nWhile some of his team-mates are getting frustrated and struggling to be patient and composed, Virat will find something funny and deftly defuse the situation.\nSo he continues to thrive, and so his Indian team continue to enjoy remarkably consistent success at ICC tournaments.\nNot long ago, on the morning after an away match in the Indian Premier League, I arrived at breakfast in the hotel to find Virat sitting on his own.\nWe started chatting about the game of cricket, a little about the pressures and the expectations... but mostly we spoke about the fantastic privilege to play for and to captain your country, and we agreed that we should savour every moment of what, to be honest, remains a special and wonderful way to make a living.\nVirat is five years younger than me, so I asked him: \"How long do you think you will keep playing the game?\"\nHe responded instantly, eyes alight.\n\"I'm going to play forever,\" he said, his face breaking into a broad smile.\nAnd so 'forever' continues on Sunday at The Oval.","summary":"There are a few people who would love to be standing in Virat Kohli's shoes this weekend, leading their national team into the final of Champions Trophy, and there is no doubt the captain of India will be relishing the prospect of Sunday's final against Pakistan at The Oval.","id":40306937}

But as Lorde tweeted, the #showgoeson.\nLorde was praised for showing up, comfy trainers and all.\nThe official VMA account tweeted a picture of the singer seeming to jump on the stage and the caption: \"The ground is the flu trying to stop you glowing up at the #VMAs.\"\nEnd of Twitter post  by @vmas\nFans were impressed on Twitter too, with one saying: \"If Lorde can perform at the VMAs with the flu, I can definitely make it through this week in one piece.\"\nEnd of Twitter post  by @nikki_camm\nShe's not the first star to rock up to a gig when full of the lurgy. So who else has battled on regardless?\nFans got a bit more than they bargained for when Justin Bieber was sick on stage - twice - back in 2012.\nHe was performing in Arizona as part of the Believe tour when he vomited twice. He left the stage each time, but came back to finish the show and even did an encore.\nBieber later told fans he was \"getting better\" and that \"milk was a bad choice\".\nThe following year he had to take a 20-minute break mid-set due to breathing problems - but once again, he insisted on getting to the end of the performance. What a pro.\nPerhaps Biebs could have shared stories with Rihanna about his experiences - as the same thing had happened to her while she was playing in Portugal.\nShe was at Lisbon's Atlantico Arena when she had to run off during What's My Name to be sick.\nRiRi tweeted a fan at the time, saying she \"made it juuuust in time for RudeBoy\", with her dancers covering for her while she was ill.\nLast year, she had to cancel her Grammys performance though under doctor's orders - she was suffering from bronchitis that time.\nHaim bassist Este has type one diabetes - which means her body can't control blood sugar levels and that she needs to inject insulin.\nBut when she was playing on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2013, she realised her sugar levels were plummeting due to the fact she'd not eaten enough.\nShe came off stage and her manager checked her levels and rubbed chocolate inside her mouth to give her much-needed glucose. After two minutes, she got back on to perform the rest of the set with her sisters.\nEste admitted she had to do it \"sitting down like BB King\" however - and that now she makes sure she's had her \"fuel for the day\".\nWhen Dave Grohl fell off stage at a concert in Sweden two years ago, he broke his leg - an injury that led to the Foo Fighters cancelling their headline slot at Glastonbury that summer.\nBut get this. Even though he was in pain, and would eventually need six metal screws put in his leg, he finished the show at the Ullevi Stadium before being taken to hospital.\nAnd then, a month after the accident, he took to the stage again.\nGrohl sat on a throne decorated with guitars for a show in Washington DC to mark the 20th anniversary of the band's first album. He's seen on it above at a gig in Seoul later that month.\nBit of a vintage one now. Marillion were appearing on Top of the Pops in 1985 - but the slight problem was that singer Fish had lost his voice.\nSo what do you do in that situation? Cancel? Nope.\nInstead, Fish decided to take to the stage regardless - and hold up a flip chart with the lyrics to Lavender Blue on, ripping off the sheets as he went along.\nLuckily, the audience was up for a sing-a-long.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But is there order behind this chaos?\nThe president and his press secretary spent the weekend blasting the press and its coverage of the inauguration - and that rolling feud unsurprisingly dominated headlines.\nBehind the scenes, however, Republicans in the executive branch and Congress are getting down to the business of advancing their political agenda.\nThe president issued executive orders on trade and abortion on Monday. Congressional committees will soon begin hammering out tax and healthcare legislation.\nThe bumpy start to Mr Trump's presidency has some questioning whether the president is squandering his power, which traditionally is at its height in the first few months of a presidential term.\nPower, however, is what you make of it - and the real test of Mr Trump's strength won't be in the tut-tutting of newspaper editorial pages over tweets and ad-libbed speeches, it will be policies enacted and legislation signed.\nWhile it's easy to dismiss Mr Trump's moves as missteps, if conservatives continue to charge through the chaos, they may learn to love their new president's unconventional style.\nThe US Senate was also expected vote on Mr Trump's nomination of Mike Pompeo to be CIA director.\nRex Tillerson's nomination as secretary of state was effectively guaranteed on Monday as Senator Marco Rubio dropped his objections.\nMeanwhile, Mr Spicer said it was \"unquestionable\" that Mr Trump's inauguration \"was the most watched\" ever.\nAlthough Ronald Reagan's was top in terms of television figures, attracting 41.8 million viewers, Mr Spicer pointed out that the 30.6 million who tuned in to see Mr Trump take the oath of office did not include the millions who watched the ceremony online.\nHis remarks followed Mr Trump's stinging attack at the weekend on media reporting of attendance figures and the weather at his inauguration.","summary":"President Donald Trump has fulfilled a campaign pledge by signing an executive order to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).","id":38721056}

{"document":"Old hands at the book club game are husband and wife team Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan and Oprah. Their clubs began on TV but the new breed has, from the off, been virtual - online and on apps.\nAnd the main players are almost exclusively female, including Emma Watson, Reese Witherspoon, Florence Welch, Zoella and Sarah Jessica Parker, as are the clubs' members.\nIt would be easy to be cynical about this new trend but it has its merits, says Claire Armitstead, associate editor for culture at the Guardian.\n\"These celebrities want to show they are intelligent people and not just celebrities, that's perhaps their motive for it.\n\"But what they bring is their brand. There are so many books in the world that any kind of 'sorting hat', to use a Harry Potter term, is a good thing for reading.\"\nDebut writer Caz Frear knows the benefit of star endorsement. This week she sees her first novel, crime thriller Sweet Little Lies, hit the shelves after winning Richard and Judy's second Search for a Bestseller competition.  She says it was the couple's name that encouraged her to enter.\n\"It was the possibility of their validation, they are huge names in the literary world. You think, if they like it then I must have something. There were other competitions that weren't small fry but I wanted to put myself in the strongest position.\"\nThe Richard and Judy club has grown into a polished brand  in collaboration with high-street chain WH Smith since starting on the couple's Channel 4 chat show in the early 2000s.\nNow only online (and in stores), it is more successful, says Madeley. \"I knew it would be fine, we are a brand and, in fact, we're selling more books than before... the internet is king.\nBooks are submitted for consideration by publishers, which inevitably leads to recurring well-known names. But the final selections - issued three times a year - are made on quality alone, says Madelely.\n\"We choose a lot of established names, yes, but it's entirely on merit. We love finding new talent like Caz... you need fresh blood all the time... books are the stuff of life.\"\nIf he and Finnigan keep an eye on the new celebrity clubs, it's from an interested, not competitive, stance. \"We're all out there to get people reading,\" says Madeley.\nA recent survey by The Reading Agency showed two thirds of people would like to read more but are too busy.\nYet, the agency's chief executive supports Armitstead's \"sorting hat\" theory: \"Most people also said they struggled to find a book they liked. Recommendations are the most likely thing to convince people to read more literature... however they are signposted to books, it can only be a good thing,\" says Sue Wilkinson.\nHarry Potter star Emma Watson points her followers towards powerful feminist literature through her club Our Shared Shelf (OSS) on the Good Reads website. She is also active on Instagram.\nWatson launched OSS in 2016 following her appointment as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and her HeForShe speech.\nEvery two months she selects a book for her 193,000-plus members to absorb and discuss.\nSelections have included Gloria Steinem's My Life on the Road and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale - now enjoying renewed interest possibly due to a heady combination of a Channel 4 dramatisation, Watson's endorsement and the topicality of its issues.\nWatson's enterprise is clearly serious and she's left books for others to find on the London and New York undergrounds.\n\"Emma Watson with her feminist classics is placing herself as a young thinking woman but doing it through her position as a UN ambassador is quite structured,\" says Armitstead. \"Similarly, if someone wants to project themselves as a fun person they are going to choose fun books.\n\"Emma Watson will have people advising her, probably in order to push the kind of books the organisation thinks people should be reading.\n\"It is a good thing for a woman to read Gloria Steinem but has Emma Watson?\"\nRelaxed and seemingly without agenda is Florence Welch's Between Two Books on Twitter.  Her fan website also promotes the club.\nIt was established by Welch enthusiasts in dedication of her love of reading, demonstrated in her regular online posts about books. She got involved at their invitation.\nWelch suggests a wide range of literature, from Eimear McBride's The Lesser Bohemian to the poetry of Ted Hughes. She also involves her music mates, so that Nick Cave and Bat for Lashes have flagged up choices.\nWelch dips in and out of the 11,000-plus members' discussions and even offers the chance to meet her, authors and each other at book events such as the Borris Festival.\nUnlike some other clubs which are more inclined towards just showcasing the star's reading, Watson and Welch's are clubs in the traditional sense. They allow like-minded people \"to get together\" (literally in Welch's case) and talk.\nAnd the fans love it.\n\"The club (Between Two Books) is for fans and managed by fans, ordinary, lovely and like-minded people,\" says one ardent fan, Kawanna Pena Cepeda, from the Dominican Republic.\n\"It makes it more approachable and grounded. It doesn't have any 'agenda'... other than share amazing literature that our queen, Florence, loves.\n\"It's an amazing way to connect with other Flo fans other than by her music. It's exciting to think the book you are currently reading, Florence is reading as well... it feels like we are connected.\"\nSimilarly, Maritza Jimenez in Chicago, Illinois says she joined OSS \"because I really admire Emma Watson\".\n\"To have that instant connection (however small) feels really good. Then, I put some serious thought into what she's trying to do... open up a discussion on women's issues... it's a complex topic to tackle because it is a very human issue.\"\nAuthors and the book industry are also reaping benefits from this endorsement.\n\"Steinem's My Life on the Road, Emma Watson's first title, had a 200% boost week on week in the UK for the second week of January 2016, from 138 copies to 415,\" says Lisa Campbell of the Bookseller.\nAnd a true powerhouse in driving author interest, and sales is Reese Witherspoon.  The actress has become \"a champion of female fiction writers\", says Isabelle Broom, book reviews editor at Heat magazine.\nHer book club is on Instagram, with 71,000-plus followers. She also talks books on Twitter. And, she has an eye for a story which is prime for movie adaptation and is quick to buy the rights through her production company, such as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl.\nBroom describes the actress as a \"positive force of good\" and authors are effusive too, among them Jessica Knoll, writer of Luckiest Girl Alive.\n\"[Witherspoon's] support has immensely boosted Luckiest Girl Alive's visibility and sales,\" says Knoll. \"It was featured in a lot of traditional media and that definitely had a cumulative impact, but when Reese featured my book... I noticed an immediate and enormous uptick in my Amazon ranking.\nThe Zoella Book Club, also supported by WH Smith and just relaunched for 2017, has also had industry impact - and on teenage girls.\nWith a recent National Literacy Trust study suggesting reading for pleasure falls after primary school years, the club helmed by 27-year-old Zoe Sugg - the fashion and beauty YouTube vlogger known as Zoella - is arguably a good thing.\nAuthor Alex Bell's Frozen Charlotte was chosen for Zoella's 2016 crop of reads and she says \"it meant the book was able to reach a much wider audience than it would otherwise\".\n\"Zoella's book club is particularly worthwhile because it helps get teenagers excited about books and reading for pleasure, which is a wonderful thing,\" she adds.\nZoella and the other female star book-clubbers demonstrate the trend for reading groups in the real world to be mostly (90%) made up of women, according to Sue Wilkinson at the Reading Agency.\nHeat's Isabelle Broom suggests this is because \"women like to feel part of something, and lots of us like to feel validated, too... Plus, us girls LOVE to chat\".\nBut, while the reason needs further investigation, says Wilkinson, what is clear is that \"real\" book clubs - in libraries, homes and pubs - are still a big deal, and the agency has more than 4,000 in its reading groups network.\nAnd what of the future of the virtual celebrity club?\n\"They have a shelf-life and people like Emma Watson will get bored and start looking for the next new thing,\" says Claire Armitstead.\n\"But someone else will come along. There's no end of people who want to hitch their wagon to the star of reading.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

{"document":"The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) has taken a look at Network Rail's performance between April and October this year, and found it wanting in key areas.\nMaintenance work is already \u00a340m over budget, and rising.\nPunctuality is 0.7% below target.\nAnd the ORR has once again cast doubt on the data that Network Rail uses to make important decisions on which bits of the network to mend or renew, and when. Bad data means more delays for passengers and higher costs for the taxpayer.\nTo give you an example, maintenance crews across Britain record what they do in different ways.\nNetwork Rail told me that in some parts of the country they use miles, in other parts they use kilometres, so when two teams record the fact that they've fixed \"three units\" of line, some mean three miles, others mean three kilometres. I don't need to spell out what a mess that makes.\nAnd it doesn't end there. Some fill in forms, others use electronic devices. If you bear in mind that over the six months covered by this health check, about 35 million work orders were generated by maintenance staff, you can imagine how confusing it all gets.\nThe regulator has been trying to crack the whip on the reliability of this data for some time now. But there's a legacy of red tape on the railways, and it won't be cheap to sort out.\nRichard Price at the ORR says: \"Without up-to-date knowledge, Network Rail will not have sufficient understanding of how and why its assets fail and its maintenance approach will remain reactive - leading to inefficiencies and hindering its efforts to improve punctuality.\nHe adds: \"The new management at the company has made it clear that it shares our concerns and has committed to address these issues.\"\nThe current overspend is a worry too. Network Rail has a \u00a338bn budget for the next five years, so how is it already \u00a340m over-budget, and heading for \u00a3122m across the year?\nWell, it's mainly down to two extra projects.\nThe relatively new boss, Mark Carne, has ordered a clean-up of the lines. All those spare bits of old track you see lying about, the old mattresses, the Buddleia - he wants it all gone.\nThe second project goes back to red-tape again. Mark Carne wants a much slimmer, more-focused safety book for maintenance staff. Again, there's a legacy of thousands of rules that he wants cut, so that people understand what to focus on.\nMark Carne hails from the oil industry, don't forget, and in our last interview he talked a lot about safety culture.\nHis response to today's report?\n\"The railway continues to see strong growth in passenger numbers, however, we know that there are too many passengers that do not get the level of reliability they have a right to expect and that this has a real impact on their daily lives.\n\"Increasing capacity on a complex network, at the same time as keeping it running every day, is the challenge we face. We have clear strategies to deliver the improvements required.\"\nThere is one positive highlight from the regulator.

{"document":"Growing up in diamond-rich eastern Sierra Leone, it was the natural thing to do.\nJobs were, and still are, few and far between, so the gemstones were a magnet. They persuaded many to drop out of school, but I worked as a miner mostly during school holidays and sometimes at weekends.\nThe Kono District was densely populated because the sparkling stones could be found virtually everywhere, sometimes through sheer luck.\nMy parents joined thousands of people from across the country, as well as The Gambia, Mali, Senegal and even Lebanon, to go to Kono in the hope of making a quick fortune.\nBlistered palms\nI grew up there and my work as a miner was hard. I dug the river beds for gravel and extracted the often muddy earth looking for diamonds.\nThe pickaxes and shovels would blister my palms and the sieve would harden or even deaden my fingers, often breaking my fingernails.\nAnd because I had to also lift sacks full of dry red tropical gravel, my head and neck were almost always in pain.\nDiamond deposits were sometimes so close to the surface in parts of Kono that it was common for people to pick up tiny gemstones that had been loosened by a heavy downpour.\nI found a tiny stone once or twice in my birthplace, Bumpeh. I did not know their true worth, but got enough money to see me through for about a week.\n1. Cullinan Diamond, found in South Africa in 1905, weighed 3,107 carats\n2. Lesedi La Rona, found in Botswana in 2015, weighed 1,111 carats\n3. Excelsior Diamond, found in South Africa in 1893, weighed 995 carats\n4. Star of Sierra Leone, found in Sierra Leone in 1972, weighed 969 carats\n5. Incomparable Diamond, found in DR Congo in 1984, weighed 890 carats\nSource: Mathew Nyaungwa, Rough and Polished\nAfter doing my school-leaving exams, I took to full-scale mining to help pay for my university studies.\nApart from mining in Kono, I also went to Tongo Fields in neighbouring Kenema District. There, I discovered that the life of an artisanal miner was like that of an indentured labourer.\nDiamond diggers generally had two layers of sponsorship, and still do. The Group of Geng, or Gang, is what the diggers are called.\nIn language which harks back to the days of slavery, each group has a Master who looks over them. He is also in charge of providing food, accommodation and medicine.\nBut when I was there, conditions were such that only one square meal a day was assured - and please do not ask how the sauce tasted.\nWe often slept on the floor of a room or veranda, with bedbugs and mosquitoes biting us in turns. As for health care, Panadol was all we would get if we fell ill.\nThen there was the Supporter - the person who would provide the funds for the Master.\nWe rarely got to know him personally. He tended to be a big businessman or diamond dealer, and he provided us with tools and monthly allowances.\nLike me, most diggers did not know - and still do not know - the real value of their diamonds. So, it was easy for the Master and the Supporter to connive and dupe us about the price.\nThere is a group known as Gado Geng. They prefer to sponsor themselves and sell their diamonds on their own.\nBut my three-member team had a Master. We worked on a licensed plot.\nHowever, one day, we went to do illicit mining at an abandoned site belonging to the then state-owned National Diamond Mining Company.\nTwo of us were on the sieve, the third shovelling the pile of gravel. I was busy shaking the sieve under the water to wash the mud off the stones.\nThen I saw a sparkling object right in the middle of the sieve.\nI was not sure if it was a diamond or corundum, a sparkling stone that has little value. I brought up the sieve, to be sure.\nI went straight to the spot to try to separate it from the rest of the stones and sand.\nMy heart pounded. I excitedly muttered to my colleagues: \"Na diamond,\" a Krio phrase for \"It's a diamond\".\nI made sure that I did not say it loudly for fear that someone in the distance would hear me.\nMy colleague, Yarpo, dropped the bucket and shovel to verify my find. He agreed that it was a diamond.\nWe flung the tools away and dashed into the tall swampy grass. We then fled before anyone could catch us.\nObviously, we kept our Master in the dark and sold the two-carat diamond to a local dealer for 100,000 leone. I am not sure how many US dollars that was worth in 1991, but it was a lot of money.\nI was the youngest, but the other two diggers treated me fairly.  We split the money, and they gave me 34,000 leone, a little more than my share.\nUnlike many other diamond diggers, I did not waste any of it on buying brightly-coloured sneakers, jeans, shirts or cassette players.\nI had a clear idea what I was going to do with it - pay my first year university fee of around 24,000 leone.\nDream fulfilled\nAs I was still awaiting my school exam results, I  gave the money to my aunt to add to her capital and do some business.\nI went back to concentrate on mining, but it turned out to be the last time that fortune would smile on me as a digger.\nI always wanted to become a journalist as I was born with the BBC World Service blaring in our home.\nMy dad, who never went to school, was addicted to it. And there were old newspapers and magazines lined up under his mattress and piled up elsewhere in his tiny bedroom.\nHowever, Sierra Leone's Fourah Bay College did not offer journalism at the time. So, my instinct told me to study English and French for an international edge.\nI graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and went on to work as journalist.\nLike me, my children have grown up with the BBC World Service , except that my voice is among the voices that they hear.","summary":"In my teens, I worked as an artisanal miner, waist deep in water, sieving the gravel to find a diamond.","id":39478462}

{"document":"Younger people take religion seriously \"when they have the chance to learn about it,\" he said.\nAnd Cardinal Keith O'Brien, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, urged Christians to wear a cross to symbolise their beliefs.\nIt comes amid a growing debate about secularisation in British society.\nMeanwhile, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have attended traditional Easter Sunday service at Windsor Castle.\nDuring the service at Canterbury Cathedral, Dr Williams said it was the wrong time to \"downgrade the status and professional excellence\" of religious education in schools.\nRE is not one of the subjects counting towards the English Baccalaureate, the standard for ranking schools brought in by the coalition government.\nThe English Baccalaureate ranks secondary schools in England according to the number of pupils who get good GCSEs in English, maths, science, another language and a humanities subject - either geography or history.\nSupporters of religious education want to see it included in the humanities category.\nBy Robert PigottReligious affairs correspondent, BBC News\nDuring his decade as leader of the Church of England, Dr Williams has repeatedly complained that Christianity is being marginalised in British public life.\nToday he welcomed what he said was a reduction in active hostility towards religion, but issued a new warning.\nIt was that \"serious and liberal-minded commentators\" were embracing religion as a socially useful tool - for example for rethinking our \"destructive economic habits\" - but wanted to \"pick out the best bits of religion without all the embarrassing beliefs that go with it\".\nThe archbishop insisted that it was precisely those awkward beliefs - such as the actual resurrection of Jesus - that mattered in Christianity, and that without them it would cease to make sense.\nHis fear is that Christianity might survive the active hostility of atheists, only to succumb to a kind of asset stripping which reduced it to a set of well-meaning principles without really saying anything about God.\nBut the government says it is already a compulsory National Curriculum subject and the English Baccalaureate is to encourage more students to take up geography and history in addition to RE - not instead of it.\nIn his sermon, Dr Williams said: \"There is plenty to suggest that younger people, while still statistically deeply unlikely to be churchgoers, don't have the hostility to faith that one might expect, but at least share some... sense that there is something here to take seriously - when they have a chance to learn about it.\n\"It is about the worst possible moment to downgrade the status and professional excellence of religious education in secondary schools.\"\nDr Williams said a hostility towards faith and religion in public life may have been tempered by a recent appreciation of the social value of religion.\nBut he said the ultimate test of Christianity was not whether it was beneficial to the human race, but whether the resurrection of Jesus Christ actually happened.\nHe said that for Christians a vision of reconciled love between people \"is there only because God raised Jesus\" and that the answer was not in scientific proof, but by the way believers lived with and in their faith.\nThe latest debate on faith in Britain was ignited after Conservative co-chairwoman Baroness Warsi warned that the nation was under threat from a rising tide of \"militant secularisation\".\nThe Muslim peer said in February that Europe needed to become \"more confident and more comfortable in its Christianity\".\nResearch carried out in the same month by a secularist foundation suggested three-quarters of people who describe themselves as Christian in Britain displayed only a low level of belief and practice of the religion.\nThe Ipsos Mori poll, for the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, was rubbished by the Church, with Reverend Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St Paul's, saying it was not fair to trump people's \"self-identification\" as Christians.\nIn his Easter Sunday sermon, Cardinal O'Brien told worshippers to \"wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ\" each day of their lives.\nHe also voiced concern at the growing \"marginalisation\" of religion.\nDr Williams also issued a call for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East.\nHe said: \"A visit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, will convince you why the state of Israel exists and must go on existing.\n\"A visit to any border checkpoint will convince you that the daily harassment and humiliation of Palestinians of all ages and backgrounds cannot be a justifiable or even sustainable price to pay for security.\"\nHe said: \"We have to prod and nag and encourage the religious leadership in the Holy Land on all sides to speak as if they believed in a God who acts, not only a God who endorses their version of reality.\n\"We have to pray, to pray for wisdom and strength and endurance for all who are hungry for peace and justice, pray that people will go on looking for a truly shared future.\"\nIn March, Dr Williams announced he would step down as Archbishop of Canterbury - the head of the Church of England - in December, after 10 years in the role.","summary":"Rowan Williams has warned against \"downgrading\" religious education in secondary schools in his last Easter sermon as Archbishop of Canterbury.","id":17646549}
{"document":"Consider the unreliable plumbing, dated wallpaper, and room service meals that can arrive an hour late and stone cold.\nBut a German tech start-up called Triprebel hopes to overcome one of the most vexing obstacles to a pleasant stay; paying too much for your room.\nBecause nothing spoils a trip more than leaving your expensive single room to eat breakfast beside another guest who paid far less for their penthouse suite.\nThat concern is the driving focus for Triprebel's CEO, Carlos Borges, who describes the new website as the \"smartest way to book your hotel.\"\nHe says current travel search engines - think Expedia, Kayak or Orbitz - offer users a snapshot hotel rate at the precise moment they initiate a search. But the market for hotel rooms, he explains, \"is not like a snapshot, it's like a movie.\"\nIn short, room amenities and prices fluctuate, like plot twists.\nTriprebel's algorithm constantly checks the rates for each hotel room, from the moment it is booked, until a couple of days before a guest checks in.\n\"So if the rate goes down,\" Mr Borges says, \"we change it automatically for you and you get the full advantage of that better rate.\"\nThat 'full advantage' means a refund of the difference in price, with the firm taking a commission on the cheaper replacement booking.\nTriprebel's numbers show that a third of hotel rooms are available at a lower rate in the month after they are booked.\nThe tech start-up is one of several that have taken up residence in one of the warehouse buildings that line Hamburg's old port canals. The firm shares its building with Greenpeace and the WWF in this rapidly developing industrial neighbourhood.\nA stack of beer sits waiting in a corner for the end of the week. Mr Borges says the company's growth for the most recent quarter, which he pegs at 140%, is a reason to celebrate.\nBut before that, a half dozen staff must first test an additional 400,000 hotels that will soon be included in the website's algorithm. An employee's dog provides a welcome distraction, beneath a hanging picture of a Land Rover, with the slogan 'Never Stop Exploring.'\n\"We are travellers ourselves so we really feel good about helping our fellow travellers,\" enthuses Mr Borges, a Brazilian who originally moved to Germany to study for an MBA.\n\"When we get an email from someone praising the room he has, because he got upgraded, that's something that makes us feel very enthusiastic about what we're doing.\"\nStaffers hail from diverse professional backgrounds in Italy, Austria and the Netherlands. Currently about half the website's traffic comes from German users, and it may prove challenging to expand internationally into the already saturated online travel search marketplace.\n\"Competing with other start-ups is matter of how good your execution is and how well you're funded,\" Mr Borges says. \"So there we have a headstart, we've already been funded. We've already executed some of the technologies.\"\nBut some travel experts question not the technology, but the financial model behind the business.\nA website user is not charged a premium to guarantee the cheapest room price, but travel writer Alison Rice says the company's long-term profitability could be reliant on cooperation from the hotel industry.\n\"They like early bookings so they've got the money in the bank, they know they can stay open and pay their staff,\" says Ms Rice of hotel proprietors.\n\"What happens when, come nearer the date, they decide to drop the price to fill empty rooms and they have to pay the money back to Triprebel? I'm not sure how that will work with the hotels.\"\nTravel industry consultant, Ian Mackinnon thinks this could prove an obstacle: \"I think this will probably lead to a change whereby hotels will ask you for a deposit at the point of booking.\"\nSome independent hotels have already rebelled against the existing price comparison sites by guaranteeing that only guests that book rooms directly with them can access the lowest room prices.\nMr Borges - who says he founded Triprebel after struggling to organise a group holiday for 10 friends - says pushback from parts of the hotel sector will not upset his overall business strategy.\n\"We're building Triprebel as a shopping assistant,\" he explains as he wrestles a football from the mouth of the boisterous office dog.\n\"The end goal is that consumers can come to us, state the purchase intention and we go out there and buy the right product at the right time, considering not only hotels but the whole travel experience, from the flights to the car rental, to the hotel to the activities at the destination.\"\nAs he puts it, \"the boring part of doing the trip is up to us.\"","summary":"Frequent travellers can face a host of problems when it comes to unpalatable hotel options.","id":36129479}

The Financial Times estimated that the total weekly costs of a top musical are \u00a3150,000-\u00a3250,000.\nAnd most musicals spend years in development. The Stage estimated that the budget for the Broadway production of Groundhog Day - not a Lloyd Webber production - was $18m (\u00a314m).\nElsewhere in the West End, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has a top price of \u00a3140, while Hamilton has \u00a3200 premium tickets for when it officially moves to London in December.\nThe topic of ticket costs often arouses strong feelings. Actor Andrew Scott recently called the high prices \"disgusting\", while last year, Mark Gatiss said theatre was an \"exclusive club for rich white people\".\nLord Lloyd-Webber also pointed out that UK theatre tickets include 20% VAT - while tickets in the US are not taxed.\nThe composer was speaking to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz's Heat Map programme on BBC 5 live, and also said he is currently looking for an idea for a new musical \"rather desperately\".\n\"I must say I don't think I've ever felt more excited about musicals,\" he said. \"I feel like I'm back when I'm started.\"\nThat is partly down to a resurgence of the genre in the US with hit shows like Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen and Come From Away.

I mean, fourteen. This year we've only had two in Britain.\"\nLord Lloyd-Webber made his name in the 1970s collaborating with lyricist Tim Rice on shows like Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Evita.\nThe pair haven't worked together on a full show since - but Lord Lloyd-Webber hasn't ruled out a reunion.\n\"It's a shame in a way we didn't go on writing together but we are very different people in several ways,\" he said.\n\"Never say never, but Tim has written the lyrics to the most successful musical currently playing in the world, which is The Lion King. He's got Beauty and the Beast, he's got Aladdin.\n\"He doesn't exactly need to write. If he wanted to do something, if he wanted to come to me with an idea...

The Eagles are now looking for their eighth manager in seven years.\nAlthough it took Allardyce six games to get his first victory - with BBC Sport asking if the 'Big Sam bounce had deserted Palace' - the former Bolton, Blackburn, Newcastle and West Ham boss maintained his record of never being relegated from the Premier League.\nOnly Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Harry Redknapp and David Moyes have managed more games in the Premier League.\nAllardyce's final game in charge of Palace came on Sunday, a 2-0 loss at Manchester United, having guaranteed safety the previous week by thrashing Hull 4-0.\nFollowing defeat at Old Trafford, Allardyce indicated his plans to improve the squad in the summer.\nHe had told BBC Sport: \"We now need to grow, develop and invest.

{"document":"It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was seriously injured.\nThis was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error.\nThey knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football.\nInstead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAs a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United.\nIt has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up.\nEven in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a \u00a327.6m deal.\nIt was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOne way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May.\nIndeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking.\nAnd for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season.\nIt was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again.\nThe intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls.\nThe equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach.\nCity have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done.\nOf course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games.\nAnd after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents.\nConfidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday.\nCity can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time.\nAnd then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either.\nManchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night.\nThe kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high.\nThey were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea.\nIt was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff.\nThe superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure.\nFor long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor.\nTrue, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay.\nIn the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future.\nVan Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success.\nIf United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\nIt may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at \u00a336m from Monaco.\nExecutive vice-chairman Ed Woodward clearly wants his man to succeed and his thoughts on the future remain a mystery but there is no doubt an FA Cup win is a much harder sell than an FA Cup win and Champions League football.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device","summary":"Manchester United's coach arrived late at Upton Park amid a hail of bottles from West Ham fans that recalled scenes from football's desperate days of 1970s hooliganism.","id":36259549}

{"document":"This time, Charlotte in North Carolina is a focal point of unrest, after a black man was killed by officers this week. There have also been peaceful protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a police officer has been charged with manslaughter.\nThis is a recurring cycle of violence in the US. According to one research group, over 100 unarmed black people were killed by the police in 2015 and a string riots have occurred following similar shootings in 2016.\nBut what can be done to resolve this?\nFive US experts share their thoughts on rebuilding trust between black American communities and the police.\nLike any social problem, the first step is to simply acknowledge that a policing problem exists. I think one of the difficulties Americans are facing right now is that there is some disagreement as to whether there is a problem at all.\nOne practical thing that needs to be done immediately is to push towards more community policing. It really changes the dynamic, the cultural dynamic, because officers are members of the communities they operate in.\nIf a citizen shops at the same grocery store as his local police officer, they will recognise each other as human.\nI think a lot of the problems we see have to do with geography. You have to put people in the same geographical spaces, to occupy the same spaces.\nWhen you do, people see each other and interact with each other, not necessarily in the structured work environment, but in the unstructured social environment. That's why I think community policing works.\nChristopher Bracey is an expert on US race relations, individual rights and criminal procedure. He is professor of law at Georgetown University in Washington DC.\nThere's always a tendency to say let's train the police and they're not going to be prejudiced and the problem will go away. Well, no.\nThat's obviously important and needs to be done. But clearly, as we've seen in some of the shootings, even the officers have been black.\nI think the patterns of tension we are seeing now are rooted in long-term inequality and disadvantage.\nViolence has, for a long time, been concentrated in poor communities, especially segregated communities and minority communities that have been subject to disinvestment on the part of the state.\nSo in some sense, when you look at it scientifically, it's not really a surprise when you see occurrences of conflict between these people and the police.\nCriminal justice, housing and education reform really need to be coupled to address this issue. That is the message I see from the data.\nRobert J Sampson is director of the Boston Area Research Initiative and professor of social sciences at Harvard University.\nSource: Mapping Police Violence\/NPR\nCourts routinely award damages totalling hundreds of millions of dollars to citizens who have suffered injuries or rights violations from the police. Taxpayers pay most of those costs.\nBut as the bills pile up, there is no sign that police acknowledge, analyse or learned from their costly mistakes.\nIn other public service domains - transportation, medicine, child welfare - there are routines for studying what went wrong: warning signs that were missed, lapses in communication, procedures that can be reshaped to prevent future failure.\nWhy not in law enforcement?  Why is there not a collaborative social autopsy of these cases?\nDecades of lower crime rates and the racial breach in public confidence in the police present new opportunities to fundamentally rethink the policing model and the profession.\nJeffrey Fagan is an expert in police accountability and a Professor of Law at Columbia University in New York City.\nIt will take a range of solutions to really address this issue. Policy is a huge part of it and will have a huge impact on police violence.\nBut ultimately it will also take cultural change to address some of the beliefs and prejudices that allow these deaths to happen and allow the system to not do anything about it.\nWe need to shift the perception in America that black people are inherently criminal or that black people are inherently deserving of a punitive approach by the state.\nWe also need to have a broader conversation about what is reasonable force [when making arrests].\nYou know, in England, you have instances of people armed with knives, or in some cases armed with guns, who are not being killed by police. The police are de-escalating these situations without resulting in deadly force.\nThat seems to be the expectation. That expectation is currently not the norm in the United States.\nIt seems to be the norm of the culture here that if someone has a knife, a gun or even a toy gun that it is totally legitimate to kill them. I think that is something that needs to change.\nSam Sinyangwe is a data scientist and activist who founded Mapping Police Violence, which compiles records of police shootings in the United States.\nI think the most important thing we need to do, honestly, is to fundamentally reconceptualise what we think the job [of an officer] is about.\nFor the last three decades, we have thought about the police as an institution focused on public safety and crime reduction.\nBut that's not all they do. They do a lot of things that are nothing to do with that actually that involve helping citizens and engaging in positive ways,\nWe need agencies to focus on these things.\nIf the police are still understanding their primary role as crime reduction, then we are not going to solve this problem.\nTracey Meares served on President Obama's 2014 Policing Task Force.

And do they carry Tasers?\nNick Beake: PC Keith Palmer was an unarmed officer protecting the Palace of Westminster, but Scotland Yard says he was wearing a protective vest at the time of the attack.\nThe force said during the post-mortem examination \"the pathologist could find no obvious evidence of damage or penetration other than the vest having been cut off during emergency first aid at the scene\".\nArmed officers working at Parliament carry a primary weapon, a sidearm and a Taser.\nAnd an unspecified number of armed response vehicles - three firearms specialists in an unmarked car - are on constant patrol in central London.\nWill the pavement safety barriers removed from nearby London Bridge be restored?\nNick Beake: The use of safety barriers varies from location to location.\nThe police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public.\nThe mayor of London's office says it is currently considering where more barriers could be installed.\nWhy not build a 6in [15cm] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic?\nNick Beake: An independent review commissioned by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of London to protect pedestrians from a Nice- or Berlin-style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds.\nThe report author, Lord Harris of Haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events.\nWhat is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack?\nNick Beake: The current terrorist threat is rated as \"severe\", which means an attack is highly likely.\nThe latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if that is not possible, and then tell the authorities: \"Run, hide, tell.\"\nMore information can be found on the gov.uk website.\nWhat should we do if we see something suspicious?\nNick Beake: If you spot something suspicious, ring the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321.

{"document":"Jon Rahm's status as one of Europe's most exciting prospects was confirmed by a fine victory on the PGA Tour at Torrey Pines last Sunday.\nThe 22-year-old capped his maiden triumph with a thrilling eagle at the last, where he holed a snaking 60-footer to finish three clear of the field.\nRahm, who hails from Barrika in the Basque country of northern Spain, has made an extraordinary start to his professional career. He secured his Tour card within just four events of joining the paid ranks seven months ago.\nHaving completed a stellar college career at Arizona State, where he won the prestigious Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus awards, the youthful Spaniard was third at Congressional last year before finishing runner-up at the Canadian Open last July.\nHis rapid rise accelerated further with this victory over a strong field in California. It is little wonder Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Thomas Bjorn, was among the first to recognise the achievement.\n\"Congratulations on your first PGA Tour win,\" Bjorn tweeted. \"When you win, you might as well do it in style! What a finish.\"\nIt is a significant result for Bjorn because it has elevated Rahm into the world's top 50. All indicators suggest the Spaniard, currently ranked 46th, is likely to remain in this upper echelon for many years to come.\nAnd with a place in the top 50 comes the freedom to pick and choose tournaments on both sides of the Atlantic. With his PGA Tour card secure, the Spaniard is on schedule to be free to accept European Tour membership in time for next year's Ryder Cup.\nRahm has already stated his desire to play for Europe in Paris and under new rules would only need to play four events each season to satisfy the Tour's membership criteria.\n\"I've thought about the Ryder Cup a lot,\" he said during the World Cup at the end of last year. \"I so want to play in the matches; who doesn't? But right now I need to establish myself on the PGA Tour.\"\nThat task has already been accomplished with astonishing speed and it means the 2018 Ryder Cup can be firmly on Rahm's radar.\n\"The next one is in France and that is close to home for me,\" he said last November. \"I will be doing all I can to be there. So to answer your question: yes, I will be joining the European Tour at some stage.\n\"I am very much a European, and I want to play there. But I have taken a different route to professional golf in that I have gone to college in the US.\n\"Once I have the freedom to fly back and forth a bit more it will happen. It is my dream to represent Spain in the Ryder Cup.\"\nPhil Mickelson's brother Tim coached him at Arizona State and is now the Spaniard's agent. Phil is convinced his sibling has unearthed a golfing gem.\n\"I think there's an intangible that some guys have where they want to have the pressure, they want to be in that tough position,\" Mickelson said. \"They want to have everything fall on their shoulders. And he has that.\"\nBefore Rahm's sensational finish, Woods was the last player to win at Torrey Pines by making eagle on the closing par-5 back in 1999.\nNow the 41-year-old continues his latest comeback amid so many reminders the game is now being dominated by a much younger generation.\nAside from Rahm's triumph, there have been PGA Tour successes this year for Justin Thomas (aged 23) and Hudson Swafford (29).\nWoods is heading for the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour where a similar story has been developing. After 26-year-old Tommy Fleetwood's Abu Dhabi victory, the 21-year-old Korean Jeunghun Wang collected his third title by winning in Qatar last Sunday.\nThis week, of course, the largest galleries will gravitate towards Woods even though the 14-times major champion was less than convincing in his PGA Tour comeback last week.\nRounds of 76 and 72 led to a missed cut and it was clear that understandable rust remains after such a lengthy lay-off.\nWoods has won twice in Dubai, but this time making the cut would represent satisfactory progress. He is playing the second of four events in a hectic five-week schedule.\nHow his troublesome back stands up to the rigours of a 17-hour flight to the Middle East, even in the comfort of his private jet, will be Woods' primary concern.\nBut the magnificent Majlis course at the Emirates Club, still the best in the Middle East, will provide an ideal test as he continues to feel his way back into Tour level competition.\nIt will be fascinating to follow his progress but, given the way things are going, do not be surprised if he is overshadowed by someone nearer half his age by the time we get to Sunday's final round.","summary":"While Tiger Woods inevitably generates a frenzy of interest during his return to the European Tour, the continent has already got plenty to be excited about thanks to a new Spanish superstar in the making.","id":38800039}
{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nDo you get your business done early, or drag it out until the last minute? What tricks of the trade can an agent use? How do you keep your player happy? What kind of clauses\/add-ons go into a contract?\nBBC Sport spoke to David Seligman, an agent at CM Sports in Manchester and an expert in sports law, and renowned agent Eric Hall for some insight into the type of last-ditch negotiations that occur when the transfer window is about to shut.\nSeligman currently represents a number of Football League players while Hall's client list once included the likes of England internationals Dennis Wise, Tim Sherwood and Neil Ruddock.\n\"If it gets to deadline day, you know there isn't any time for the club to go and get somebody else, so the price goes up and you get them the better deal,\" says Seligman.\n\"If you talk to your Harry Redknapps, Alex Fergusons and Terry Venables, they won't wait until deadline day if they fancy a player,\" says Hall. \"Deadline day just gives people like me and the players extra ammunition.\n\"On deadline day, you just go 'chat, chat, chat, chat'. Keep them chatting until you're near to that deadline hour and then they will give you anything, within a certain reason, that you want. Ask for everything because as silly as some stuff may sound, you'll probably get it.\n\"I remember quite a few years ago, I took Kenny Sansom from Arsenal to Jim Smith and Newcastle and I got three times more than I probably should have got.\"\nSeligman adds: \"I negotiated a lower league player's release from his contract at one club in January and we were offered \u00a35,000 to cancel his contract two days before the window closed.\n\"We waited and one hour before the window closed I got him double that. We were playing a game of chicken - we kept saying we wouldn't accept it - and it went down to the wire and the price went up.\"\n\"It's all about assessing who has the power - the club or the player,\" says Seligman. \"I once represented a player who had not scored a goal for a long time but he had played at a high level so, in his head, he wanted to earn a certain amount of money.\n\"I eventually got him \u00a32,500 a week after one club had initially offered \u00a3700 a week. He got a \u00a310,000 signing on fee, too. From my point of view, when I first touted the player to the manager concerned, he was very interested. I gauged that by the fact he rang me back 25 minutes later after he'd done some digging and watched some videos.\n\"He said there and then there would be an email with a contract offer within the hour. At that point, I knew I had the power - he was the club's number one target.\"\n\"When you're dragging it out a little bit, that's where an agent really has to earn his corn,\" says Seligman. \"You have to find the right balance between keeping the player happy and making sure the deal is not lost.\n\"A conversation needs to be had with the player on how far they want to push it, because it's their career. If you get to a point where the player says they don't want to push it too far, then you have to agree and take the deal that's on the table.\n\"This is where a good agent and a bad agent are separated because if you're a good agent, you are able to analyse the situation and use your contacts in the game to see if a club is speaking to other players and get the player to trust you.\n\"You don't want to lose a deal, but you don't want to cave too early.\"\n\"There's no point in being underhand,\" says Seligman. \"You play them off against each other by being honest. If they think another club is interested it can ramp the wages up.\"\nHall recalls: \"I took Tim Sherwood up to Blackburn a few years ago. The same day, I was doing a deal with Derby where Arthur Cox wanted to sign Tim (who was at Norwich at the time).\n\"I was playing games with my lovely mate [then Rovers manager] Kenny Dalglish and I kept him hanging on. You play one against the other. But if you're good at your job, you shouldn't play too many games. You mustn't underestimate chairmen either because most have the money to buy a club because they are good businessmen. They are not idiots.\"\n\"Another trick is to say the deal if off by saying the offer is unacceptable,\" says Seligman. \"Or you can bring a player's family into it and say the player can't justify the travel because he's got a young family, and then the club say they'll put him up in a flat and help out with that. If the club really want the player it is important to not only look after him but his family too.\n\"Conversely, I had a player last summer who was offered 50% more than what he was earning at the time elsewhere but he turned it down because his girlfriend couldn't move. That's just the real world - she couldn't move in her line of work.\"\n\"I had one player who wouldn't take a second year at a club because he thought he would get a bigger move and earn more money elsewhere - on the advice of his wife,\" recalls Seligman. \"He got paid up after six months.\n\"I've had a lot of English lads who are small and they say to me they want to make it in Spain,\" says Seligman. \"'The game is better suited to me in Spain', 'my dad said it'd be better for me in Spain' but I tell them that if they are good enough to play professionally in Spain, they are good enough to play professionally in England.\n\"People don't like being told a few home truths, but as an agent you have to balance it. You're dealing with human beings who are temperamental and footballers can be more temperamental and egotistical than most.\"\n\"It can be useful to use media stories and hype too,\" admits Seligman. \"If a player gets talked about a lot, whether it be on social media or in the press, there is more attention attracted to them.\n\"If you have a player who is spoken about a lot, you have people wanting to watch him. I had a player who was scouted by a Championship club (he eventually signed for another Championship club) because there were just so many people talking about him and they didn't want to miss out. You have to create that 'don't want to miss out' philosophy.\n\"I've put out stories before now saying that my client has been watched by three or four clubs in a higher division because (a) it's true and (b) it raises their profile.\"\n\"I've already told my players to build up their Twitter following over the next few months and when it comes to negotiations, we can get clauses built in there,\" says Seligman.\n\"If you're a player at a club and you're always giving away your boots, shirts and signed stuff, the fans will love you. Becoming a fans' favourite gives you more power, it helps when you're negotiating a new contract.\n\"Also, you can go to a club on a commercial level and say 'Look, I've got 20,000 followers on Twitter and you can put promotions out via my Twitter feed. That can aid the club, and in return I want an extra \u00a3100 a week.' That's a more innovative term in a contract.\n\"If you have two identical players and you're not sure which one to choose but there's one who you can make more money out of commercially, social media is a new way of doing that,\" adds Seligman.\n\"We've seen financial analysts and pundits justifying high transfer fees and wages for Gareth Bale at Real Madrid and David Beckham at LA Galaxy by the amount of shirts they sell. It's that but on a smaller scale. It's all about making more money.\"\n\"I had a player called Richard Duffy, who was on loan at Coventry from Portsmouth,\" says Hall. \"His loan was due to finish about a week before the deadline and then I got a call from Coventry.\n\"They said they wanted to keep my player until the end of the season. I said 'That's great, if Portsmouth agree, but I want three times more for his wages, plus this, that, a car and a little house for him to live with his girlfriend.'\n\"Because it was a couple of days before the window was going to shut, and Coventry were struggling at the time, they came up with it.\"\nSeligman adds: \"A lot of the time, I get my client a relocation fee or expenses. I use a guy who is really good at relocating players. He sources everything like schools, nurseries\u2026 whatever is necessary.

{"document":"It forced the band to remain anonymous for almost a year: No photographs, no interviews, no videos.\nBut there was an upside. Last year, as she caught a train home from Heathrow, she sat next to a passenger \"covered in blood [with] no teeth, looking sorry for himself\".\n\"I tentatively went up to him and his girlfriend and said, 'I just wanted to let you know you'll be fine',\" recalls the 27-year-old.\n\"'Go to the dentist tomorrow, don't panic, you'll be great'. And he was like, 'Oh, thank you so much!'.\n\"And then this guy opposite us piped up, 'I broke my nose, too!'. And suddenly this whole little carriage was talking about their injuries, which was remarkable.\n\"When I got off the Tube, I was so excited. Chatting to strangers gives you such a buzz because there's that element of fear before you talk to someone.\n\"So I walked from Brockley station back to my house, singing into my phone. And I've got this really funny voice note, which is like, 'I'm getting high on humans!'\"\nLater, Josephine sent the melody to her musical partner, Anthony West, saying, \"We have to write a song about this tomorrow\".\n\"I just sent a text back saying, 'You're crazy,'\" he laughs, but the demo was worked up into a full song, High on Humans, which features on the band's upcoming second album, Ultralife.\nLike her Tube journey, the song tingles with nervous energy, capturing that extraordinary feeling of connecting with other people; a theme that runs through the record.\nThe duo were moved to write about \"what it means to be a human in this day and age\" after a head-spinning two years, in which their music became an online phenomenon, resulting in a record deal and a tour that ran to more than 200 shows around the world.\nThe success caught them completely off guard. Oh Wonder was conceived as a songwriting project, whereby the two musicians could subsidise their solo careers by giving songs to other artists.\nIn September 2014, they created a Soundcloud page and, prompted to describe themselves, wrote: \"Writing duo, one song a month\".\n\"We thought it was a good way to build up a portfolio over a year,\" explains Josephine. Then their first song, Body Gold, amassed 100,000 plays in just three days.\n\"We thought it was a fluke,\" says Anthony. \"But then we uploaded something the next month, and the same thing happened. And it just kept snowballing.\n\"On the first of every month, we'd go to a little coffee shop and just release a song and thousands of people would play it. It was amazing. It was the best year ever.\"\nInitially, they stayed incognito - partly because of their mantra \"it's about the art, not the artist\", but mainly because of Josephine's injuries.\n\"I had no teeth,\" she grimaces. \"It was a really ill-timed accident.\"\n\"For a while, she had a little lisp,\" adds Anthony, who had to edit all of his partner's vocals to remove the erroneous \"esses\".\nRecording on a budget of just \u00c2\u00a3200, they hit upon a vocal style where both musicians sing in unison, with Josephine's voice in the centre, and Anthony singing twice, once in the left ear and once in the right.\nThe technique was actually a happy accident - they'd recorded two sets of vocals so the songs could be pitched to both male and female artists, but their managers advised them to blend the two takes, and it became Oh Wonder's unique sonic signature.\nFans, it seemed, couldn't get enough of it.\n\"Because we released a song a month over a long period, our fans had a year of their lives soundtracked by our music,\" says Josephine.\n\"Rather than just, 'Oh, I really like that song you did,' we get, 'You released that song when I was at university or I had moved to a different country'. We get the most heart-warming stories. Hundreds a week.\"\nAnthony recalls a gig in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where a 50-year-old woman approached the band to express her gratitude for the band's music. Her son, who had recently died of cancer, had been a fan. In his final months, they would wait on tenterhooks for every new release.\n\"When he died, she was with him and they were listening to his favourite song,\" says Anthony. \"And she said, 'I thank you so much because now, when I listen to that song, my son is there with me.'\"\nStories like that helped alleviate the drudgery and loneliness of touring - \"when you go from 3,000 people screaming your name to being back in the dressing room, on your own, eating a yoghurt.\"\nBeing whisked around the world has changed the two musicians in ways they never expected.\n\"I've found that I've become fiercely loyal now,\" says Josephine. \"If someone has an engagement party and I've said I will be there, I will cancel everything, even if it really compromises things, in order to make it.\"\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is what Ultralife - both the album and its title track - is about.\n\"You and I will both have days where we're really sad, like, 'it's Friday night and I'm in on my own and there's no food in the fridge and I'm miserable,'\" says Josephine.\n\"And the next day you wake up and you're like, 'I feel fantastic, I feel so liberated and empowered and I have loads of mates and it's incredible.'\n\"Ultralife is the word we use to symbolise the someone or something in your life that pulls you out of those trickier moments and into the celebratory, ultra version of yourself.\"\nSo who is that person for Oh Wonder?\n\"We haven't been asked that yet!\" laughs Josephine, before Anthony chips in with a vague answer about friends and family.\nMany assume the duo are a real-life couple - but they have been doggedly reluctant to discuss a potential romance, even though they live together and have an uncanny knack for finishing each other's sentences.\n\"People think we're brother and sister, which suits us just fine,\" Josephine told one interviewer.\nInstead, they want the focus to be their music, which they wrote eyeball-to-eyeball over a piano in a rented AirB&B apartment in New York.\nCompared to their first album, Ultralife is \"pumped full of energy\", a direct response to the audience's reactions on their last tour.\nSonically, it's a big leap forward, while retaining all of the breathless boy-girl beauty of their debut.\nThe band don't want the album to propel them to Beyonce levels of fame (\"I think it would just be very lonely,\" says Josephine), but it could jeopardise their chances of striking up anonymous conversations on the Tube.\nWhich, as Anthony attests, could be a blessing.\n\"I once sat with a Danish friend on the Tube,\" he says, \"And there was two girls opposite me talking in a foreign language.\n\"Later, my friend told me they were Danish, too, and they were tearing into my shoes, talking about how awful they were.\n\"I thought they were quite normal shoes, honestly.\"\nOh Wonder's new album, Ultralife, is released on 14 July by Island Records.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

{"document":"There has been continued sniping from ministers about the level of reserves held by higher education institutions.\nEven the finance minister Jane Hutt couldn't resist having a swipe at the hundreds of millions of pounds in their coffers, before telling Good Morning Wales why she is rolling back on the proposed cutbacks because of concerns over part-time teaching and scientific research.\nMinisters stressed it was a draft budget and, like all drafts, it was open to consultation before changes were made.\nBe that as it may, there is clearly strong feeling within government that not only can universities afford it, but that their time has come to take a hit after further education colleges took one last year.\nUniversities insist the reserves are needed for investment to continue and for the sector in Wales to remain internationally competitive.\nThe stand-off between ministers and vice-chancellors was beginning to develop.\nOpposition parties were frustrated that while many of the higher education bosses were lobbying them heavily, they weren't doing so publicly, with the exception of Professor Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff university.\nBut nevertheless it was clear that universities weren't happy, and it was adding to the simmering resentment that had already developed over the government's university tuition fee policy.\nIn fact, the general cut and the tuition fees policy became enmeshed because the Welsh government had argued that much of the cash reduction was in fact staying in the system because the money was being re-directed to fee subsidies, rather than going directly to the institutions.\nThe comeback from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was that only around 60% of the tuition fee grants will stay in Wales as the fees follow the students, wherever they choose to go.\nIn the end, a political decision was taken not to get involved in a scrap with vice-chancellors.\nAs we head into an election campaign, there's an argument to say it would have been a huge distraction but also a potential opportunity for the Welsh government to show it wasn't afraid to make unpopular decisions.\nLabour want the headlines from their latest budget to be about the extra money going into the NHS, and not a fight over funding for scientific research.\nIt didn't work yesterday but that is one day, rather than a lingering dispute lasting weeks.","summary":"If Labour are still in power after the assembly election, I get the impression it will have some unfinished business with universities.","id":35542850}

{"document":"A team from Cardiff University has spent the last month excavating Caerau hill fort near Ely.\nIt is smaller than its contemporaries at Pentyrch and Pontprennau and had been thought to be inferior in status.\nBut structures and artefacts so far unearthed suggest the fort remained important well into the Roman era.\nUntil now it has been thought that the fort was purely a stronghold of the Silurian tribe who inhabited this part of Wales from around the 5th Century BC, falling into disuse once they were finally defeated by the Romans, circa 75 AD.\nHowever the initial dig this summer has uncovered a considerable amount of new information, including three Iron Age roundhouses and a stone-built pathway that runs around the edge of the hill fort, suggesting to the experts a possible domestic and\/or political dimension.\nAlso, the mix of Silurian and Roman artefacts may indicate that the fort was occupied much later than had been thought, and that the two groups might have mingled there.\nDr Oliver Davis, from the university's School of History, Archaeology and Religion, said: \"People think of these sites as defensive structures, but our attention is turning to whether the people who lived there were actually developing a community or collective identity for themselves.\n\"Our community excavations show that occupation at the site continued until at least the third century AD, well into the Roman period.\n\"Domestic life is indicated by the discovery of simple tools and ceramics from all periods.\n\"A glimpse of the personality of the inhabitants is provided by the discovery of a glass bead of Iron Age date and an enamelled disc brooch of Roman date.\n\"Both these objects indicate that individuals were concerned with their appearance, and that life in the past was a little more colourful than we sometimes think.\n\"Over the past month the team has also examined the inner of the three ramparts that surround the hill fort. These ramparts and their associated ditches were unlikely to have been built just for defence.\"\nBut as well as colour from the past, Dave Horton, of the community organisation Action in Caerau and Ely, said the way local residents have had a hand in the discoveries has also lent a little colour to the present.\n\"The last few weeks have seen a whirlwind of activity in Ely and Caerau focused around our beautiful iron-age hill fort,\" he said.\n\"Literally hundreds of local people have visited the site and have dug together, learned new skills, shared local knowledge, and have celebrated together with a fantastic Iron Age hog roast.\"\n\"We have all walked down the hill to our homes with a different perspective.

{"document":"Tall, poised and elegant, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde has been described as having a rock-star appeal on the international political circuit.\nBy contrast, Mexico's central bank governor Agustin Carstens, is known for his rotund figure, which is often portrayed in Mexican political cartoons.\nBut Mr Carstens, 53, is by no means a joke candidate in the race to lead the IMF.\nHis economic credentials cannot be doubted.\nHe graduated with an economics degree from the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, before collecting both a master's and PhD in economics from the University of Chicago, where deregulation and \"laissez-faire\" economics were the dominant views.\nIt was there that Mr Carstens, a former Little League baseball star, became a fan of the Chicago Cubs team.\nIt was also in Chicago that Mr Carstens met his wife, economist and author Catherine Mansell, who writes under the pen name CM Mayo.\nAfter obtaining his doctorate in 1985, Mr Carstens returned to Mexico where he joined the central bank and rose through the ranks, his roles including chief of staff in the governor's office and director general of economic research.\nWhile at the bank, he gained first-hand experience of dealing with financial crises, including Mexico's debt problems in the 1980s and the peso's crash in 1994 - experience which his supporters say make him the ideal candidate for the IMF.\nHe left the bank in 1999 to work as an executive director at the IMF, but returned to Mexico in 2000, serving as deputy finance minister under President Vicente Fox, marking his first ties with the conservative National Action Party.\nIn 2003, he rejoined the IMF as deputy managing director, where he was held in high regard.\nWhen he left the role in 2006, again to return to front-line Mexican politics, Rodrigo de Rato, the IMF President at the time, described him as \"a superb ambassador for the fund, who carried high credibility with policymakers\".\nServing as finance minister for three years under President Felipe Calderon, Mr Carstens was responsible for pushing through new taxes to bolster Mexico's revenues.\nBut his biggest gaffe came in early 2009 when a reporter asked him if the economic troubles in the US would affect Mexico.\nThe reporter reminded him of the saying that when the US catches a cold, Mexico usually catches pneumonia.\nMexico's economy was in good health at the time and Mr Carstens replied the country would only get \"the sniffles\".\nIn fact, Mexico's economic output fell by 6.5% that year.\nNevertheless, sniffles aside, President Calderon nominated Mr Carstens to be the next head of the Bank of Mexico, a post he has held for the past year and a half.\nBut his pledge to work closely with the government raised questions about the bank's independence.\n\"Being autonomous on monetary policy does not mean you have to be isolated from the national economic debate,\" he said at his confirmation hearing.\nMr Carstens himself acknowledges Ms Lagarde is the favourite to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the IMF.\n\"I'm not fooling myself. It's like starting a soccer game with a 5-0 score,\" he said on Monday.\nHe says he would bring \"a fresh pair of eyes\" to the role.\nA European, he says, could face a conflict of interest, given the continuing debt crisis in some eurozone countries, while he can appreciate what emerging markets can contribute to the IMF.\nBut the fact he is from the Americas could work against him.\nRobert Zoellick, from the US, currently heads the World Bank and some countries may not be keen to see the two global institutions led by officials from the same part of the world.\nTraditionally, an American has headed the World Bank while a European has been in charge of the IMF.\nAnd while Mr Carstens has the support of most of Latin America, Brazil - the region's largest economy - has yet to say whom it will back.\nFor Mr Carstens to be successful, he would almost certainly need Brazil to back him.","summary":"The two candidates competing to be the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could not be more different in their appearance.","id":13761137}

He was captured in July 2004 and transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006.\nLast year, the US stayed proceedings in a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay and transferred him to New York for the civilian trial.","summary":"The first Guantanamo detainee to be tried in a US civilian court has been sentenced to life in prison.","id":12279533}
{"document":"Early indications are of wide variations nationwide, with up to one in six missing out on their first choice of school in some areas.\nWhile in other areas, almost all got their number one preference.\nIt comes days after council leaders said two in five local authorities would have too few places by 2016.\nPressure is growing, particularly in schools on London's fringes and in cities such as Leicester, Nottingham, Reading and Peterborough.\nHowever, in London, around 99,000 pupils or 95% received a place at one of their six preferred schools this year - up 1,100 and nearly five percentage points from last year.\nOf those, 81% got into their first preference school, the same proportion as the two previous years. But there were wide local variations within the capital. In Kensington and Chelsea, only 59% got their first preference, while in Barking and Dagenham it was 91%.\nThis comes against a backdrop of an extra 900 applications in the capital this year.\nThe crisis has been precipitated mainly by a booming birth-rate, partly by immigration and by families moving specifically to be near popular schools.\nThe demand for school places has risen steeply in Harrow, which has some very good primary schools. It was predicted to be 12% over capacity by this September but the council said it had worked really hard to ensure there are enough places for Harrow children this year.\nA spokesman said the crush Harrow was seeing now was very likely to affect other areas around the country soon.\nInitial results from a Press Association survey of town halls shows families in some areas are more likely to gain a place at their top choice than in others.\nResults from Birmingham show 84.7% of children starting reception have got a place at their first preference, while 94.8% got one of their listed choices. Around one in 20 applicants - 826 children - were given a school that was not one of their preferred options. A further 3.3% - 532 youngsters - have been offered a school outside the city.\nFigures from East Sussex show 84.68% got their first choice, while in Southampton the percentage was 85.4%.\nIn Derbyshire, 93.4% of youngsters received their first pick, in Torbay it was 86.2%, Bristol was 84% - up from 82% last year, and in Cornwall it was 90.7%.\nIn Kent the figure was was 85.81%, up slightly from 84.9% last year.\nLabour and the National Association of Head Teachers also blame the coalition government's free-school policy, which has allowed some new schools to be opened in areas that already have surplus places.\nAt the same time, the ability of local authorities to plan for population surges has been reduced by regulations requiring any new schools to be either an academy or a free school, rather than a council school.\nNAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said: \"We have a balkanised system with authorities, academies and central government taking decisions in isolation.\"\nHe added: \"There is a desperate need for long-term planning that spans all sectors. With the massive increase in pupil numbers and over-stretched budgets, we cannot afford inefficiency and conflict.\"\nThe Local Government Association said the escalating places shortage was one of the key areas that needed to be tackled by the next government.\nEarlier this month, it said schools were \"reaching their limits and could soon run out of space and money for extra places\" and there would be a need for an extra 880,000 pupils at a cost of \u00c2\u00a312bn.\nThe Conservatives blame Labour for the problem saying the party \"cut over 200,000 primary school places - and even ignored official warnings to provide extra school places after a baby boom\".\nA spokesman added: \"The Conservatives have created over 400,000 school places. There are fewer children in overcrowded primary schools and, most importantly, one million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010.\"\nLabour points out that under the Conservative-Lib Dem administration the number of infant children in classes with more than 30 pupils has more than trebled from 31,265 in 2010 to 102,615 in 2015.\nShadow education secretary Tristram Hunt blamed the Conservatives for spending \"hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money on a few free schools in areas where there are no shortages of places\".\nBut Natalie Evans, director of New Schools Network, said: \"Over 90% of primary free schools opened or approved to open are in areas where new school places are needed. But they are also offering new choices in areas of low standards.\"\nLiberal Democrat schools minister David Laws said: \"It's astonishing that Labour and the Conservatives won't properly fund these children.  It will be impossible to provide a place for every child and raise standards unless we protect education budgets.\"\nTy Goddard, co-founder of think-tank Education Foundation, said England's vast education property estate could be used with more imagination, but called for the parties to work together on solving the school places issue. He said a national \"school places taskforce\" should be set up to solve the issue with clarity, speed and partnership.","summary":"More than half a million families are discovering which primary schools their children will attend, amid a growing places squeeze in parts of England.","id":32162021}

{"document":"For the second week in a row the outcome hinged on the final kick, with Lions full-back Leigh Halfpenny falling short with a penalty from halfway.\nThe Welshman's five penalties had seen the Lions lead 15-9 until five minutes from time.\nBut Wallabies centre Adam Ashley-Cooper crashed over for the only try, and Christian Leali'ifano held his nerve to land the conversion.\nIt was another riveting conclusion to a tourniquet-tight contest, but the Lions' hopes of a first series win in 16 years now hang in the balance.\nAustralia showed tremendous courage to pull the game out of the fire, and it is they rather than the Lions who will now head to Sydney with momentum.\nThe Lions, who saw captain Sam Warburton hobble off with 13 minutes left, defended heroically at times, but must now regroup for a final throw of the dice in Sydney.\nFour first-half penalties from Halfpenny, to three from Leali'ifano, nudged the Lions into a 12-9 interval lead in front of a record Etihad Stadium crowd of 56,771.\nBrian O'Driscoll's tackle on Ashley-Cooper in midfield forced the Wallabies to concede the first of eight first-half penalties.\nHalfpenny's 48-metre kick missed by the narrowest of margins, coming back off the cross-bar, but thereafter the Welshman was in his usual immaculate form.\nPenalties in the ninth, 27th, 33rd and 40th minutes saw the Lions edge a cagey first half in which neither side was able to exercise authority for any extended period.\nThe Lions appeared to have the edge at the breakdown, Australia conceding four penalties inside the opening eight minutes to earn an early warning from referee Craig Joubert.\nHalfpenny landed his first kick after the Lions drove a line-out and the Wallabies took down the maul.\nBut after a composed start, errors starting to creep into the tourists' game, with the scrum a cause for concern.\n(provided by Opta Sports)\nJoubert awarded a free-kick against scrum-half Ben Youngs for not getting the ball in quickly enough, before loose-head Mako Vunipola was twice penalised for collapsing.\nLeali'ifano, knocked out in the first minute in Brisbane but fit to take over the kicking duties this week, landed both shots at goal to edge the hosts in front.\nA knock-on as he over-stretched for a pass completed a miserable 10 minutes for Vunipola, but he responded well. First, opposite number Ben Alexander was penalised for incorrect binding, then the Lions drove the Wallabies backwards at the next scrum to earn another.\nHalfpenny landed two confident blows with the boot to nudge the Lions back in front.\nLeali'ifano levelled matters again when Dan Lydiate fell offside trying to stem a dangerous Wallabies counter-attack. But the Lions twice benefited from hoisting up high kicks as the interval approached, the second falling to George North, with Jonny Sexton maintaining the momentum through a half-break.\nWhen Ben Mowen was penalised at the ensuing breakdown, Halfpenny's fourth penalty gave the Lions a slender half-time lead.\nAustralia threw everything at the Lions in a tense and scoreless third quarter, but their defence - led by the obdurate Lydiate - initially held firm.\nThere were nervous moments aplenty and further frustrations at the scrum. The Lions lost one against the head after Youngs delayed the put-in, while O'Driscoll's pass straight to Folau allowed Australia to counter dangerously, before the Irish centre was penalised for hands in a ruck.\nThe Lions sent on Conor Murray for Youngs at scrum-half, and the Irishman immediately helped win a relieving penalty over the ball as Australia built up a head of steam.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nNorth had precious few opportunities with ball in hand, but he caught a pass and proceeded to pick up Folau and drive him backwards to galvanise his side.\nWhen they sent the Wallabies back-pedalling again at the next scrum, Halfpenny's fifth penalty in the 63rd minute stretched the lead to six points for the first time.\nThe strains of \"Swing Low, Swing Chariot\" - a demonstration of four-nation unity among the legions of red - echoed around the cavernous arena, but Australia were not done yet.\nThe dangerous Folau, stepping off his wing, was twice denied before the pressure finally told with five minutes left, O'Connor sending Ashley-Cooper crashing over.\nLeali'ifano nailed the conversion, but the Lions still had a line-out to save themselves with two minutes left. However, replacement hooker Richard Hibbard could not find his target.\nWith time up on the stadium clock, the Lions ran a penalty from their own half and got to halfway, where Australia conceded a penalty.

and some local authorities have already \"turned away cases because they were unable to provide the required places\".\nThe programme so far has required 655 homes and is estimated to need a further 4,930 before 2020, based on the size of families resettled so far.\nSome councils had been successful in partnering with the private rental sector to house refugees, the report said, but others were \"struggling to do so\".\nLocal authorities in areas where accommodation costs are high also have concerns about finding affordable accommodation for refugees given the current housing benefit cap.\nThis has meant only 11% of refugees have been settled in areas such as London and the South East.\nMeg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: \"Local authorities should be applauded for stepping up to help these people in desperate need.\n\"But already under pressure local authorities will have to find over 10,600 childcare and school places, and nearly 5,000 homes over the course of the programme as well as social and community support services.\n\"We need to be convinced that the government is committed to supporting local authorities in their efforts and is clear about its expectations and funding beyond the first year of a refugee's stay in the UK.\"\nRefugee Council head of advocacy Lisa Doyle said it was \"fantastic\" that UK communities were welcoming refugees.\nShe said: \"Each Syrian refugee welcomed by the UK will have their life transformed, if not saved by this programme.\n\"The UK government must build on this success by offering more refugees safe passage here, particularly by enabling more refugees with family here to join them smoothly and swiftly.\"\nRefugee Action chief executive Stephen Hale said: \"We are pleased that the programme has been established but I think there is a lot to do to help refugees integrate into Britain.\"\nHe said the government's funding of English language classes was \"crucial\" in helping refugees integrate.\nA government spokesman said: \"We ask local authorities to consider carefully whether they have the necessary infrastructure and support networks before a resettlement occurs.\n\"We will only resettle individuals to a particular area once we've ensured these arrangements, including school places and housing, are in place.\"\nHe added: \"The level of funding enables local authorities to provide vulnerable refugees with a safe environment and the chance to rebuild their lives.\"","summary":"The government's Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement programme could be \"at risk\" because of a lack of school places and accommodation, a National Audit Office report has warned.","id":37347264}

{"document":"They last for three months, which is long enough to sap the finances of the political parties and the energy of voters, battered by a never-ending string of cheap shots in cheap internet videos.\nCampaign 2015 is coming to the boil rather nicely now with the latest opinion polls suggesting that a centre-left alliance is running ahead of the hawkish Likud Party headed by Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThat does not necessarily mean he will be forced from office - he could still form a right-wing coalition. But election night on 17 March promises to be an exciting affair.\nOutsiders, though, might be surprised that the moribund state of the vexed peace process between Israel and the Palestinians has never felt like a major campaign issue.\nIt is there in the background all the time, of course, as the central historical and strategic issue that his faced this country since the Middle East war of 1967 when it captured Gaza from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan.\nIt captured the Golan Heights from Syria too, but that raises a different set of strategic issues which are separate from this particular diplomatic equation.\nVoters know that the Zionist Union - the name chosen for the alliance between Yitzhak Herzog's Labour Party and Tzipi Livni's movement Hatnuah - would approach the prospect of talking to the Palestinians about a \"land-for-peace\" deal with more enthusiasm than Mr Netanyahu.\nAt one point in the campaign there was a brief controversy about whether a speech Mr Netanyahu made six years ago, cautiously embracing the concept of the Two-State solution, was still valid.\nHis view appears to be that in an unstable Middle East where Iraq and Syria are disintegrating a newly-created Palestinian state could quickly become an ungoverned territory over-run by Islamist extremists.\nHis many detractors might see in that an excuse for avoiding a deal for which he did not have much enthusiasm in the first place, but part of Mr Netanyahu's pitch to the Israeli people is that he is cautious in such matters - a steady, statesmanlike hand on matters affecting Israel's security.\nSo while the peace process might be the prism through which outsiders tend to view Israeli politics, this campaign has centred much more on the economy - problems like the way in which the cost of housing outstrips the spending power of ordinary Israelis are front and centre.\nAnd what political scientists call the low-participation rate of the ultra-Orthodox communities in the economy and in the army is a major fault-line between secularists like the Yesh Atid movement and the religious parties like Shas.\nYaakov Peri is a former head of Israel's internal security agency the Shin Bet - a job which required him to reflect deeply on his country's relationship with Palestinian society as he bore responsibility for neutralising the threat of militant groups.\nBefore the last coalition collapsed he was Minister of Science and Technology and this time around he is a candidate once again for the centrist Yesh Atid.\nHe says this is an issue where it is up to the government to lead.\n\"The Israeli public cares about the cost of living and housing and the street doesn't feel the urgency of a deal with the Palestinians or a regional approach,\" he told me.\n\"It's a reality and you should look at it when running an election campaign.\"\nYou get a sense of the tensions that brought down the last coalition when you discuss the same issues with Naftali Bennett, leader of the nationalist right-wing party Habayit Hayehudi who also sat in the outgoing cabinet.\nHe has said that there should never be a Palestinian state in the West Bank because to create one would be to create an existential threat to the Jewish State.\n\"It would,\" he said, \"spell calamity for the future of Israel... handing land over to Palestinians doesn't bring peace, it brings catastrophe... This formula that the West is obsessed with, of land-for-peace simply doesn't work.\"\nIf the right wins the election, Mr Bennett is certain to be back in the cabinet where he would be a sceptical voice against any international diplomatic manoeuvring to get the two sides back to the negotiating table.\nThe Palestinian people of the West Bank and Gaza of course have no vote in Israel elections - although a small number in East Jerusalem who have applied successfully for Israeli citizenship are an exception to that rule.\nBut the Arab population of Israel itself - descendants of those who remained after the fighting in Israel's War of Independence in 1948-49 - does have the right to vote.\nIt makes up about about 15% of the electorate and that proportion will rise as its young people reach voting age.\nThe three traditional Arab parties have combined into a unified list which is hoping to raise the turnout in that community.\nAnd if they succeed, one of their candidates Aida Touma Suleiman told me, they intend to put the peace process back on the national agenda - not least because they see a clear link between economic and security issues.\n\"This should be the centre of the campaign,\" Ms Suleiman said. \"There's no issue you can discuss without making a connection to the continuation of the occupation and war policy that different governments have led in the last few years.\n\"If you want to talk about housing you need solutions that come with resources and then you should ask where the resources are in this country.\"\nOver the course of the campaign, though, those kind of connections have not dominated the national debate here.\nHow quickly the issue re-asserts itself will depend on whether victory goes to the left or to the right.","summary":"As electoral drama goes, Israeli election campaigns can be rather a slow burn.","id":31870282}

{"document":"Dear Alison\nI am compelled to write and seek review of an historic case of rape. Unusually, and contrary to current practice and the ACPO\/CPS Guidance on the Investigation and Prosecution of Rape Cases, the investigation into the serious allegations in this case was dropped before the suspect was interviewed.\nThe elements of lack of freedom and capacity to consent - which may even have triggered the \"no consent\" legal presumption - make the decision highly irregular. This is shocking in itself. It further troubles me that the senior police officer who dropped the case revealed to the victim he apparently took a series of worthless stereotypes and other irrelevant points into consideration. He did this after apparently consulting with an unnamed CPS official. Most of these stereotypes have been blown out of the water in recent months. Or so I thought.\nThere has been a sea change in the climate surrounding rape, historic cases in particular. Why is it that the tide has not reached this case? I am driven to the unpalatable conclusion that the identity of the alleged perpetrator - Leon Brittan - may in some way have influenced treatment of the case.  I hope I am wrong. But in my view the case demands your personal attention and an immediate review by the CPS Area Head of Sexual Offences.\nAs you know, I have been working with the Metropolitan police on a number of cases involving sexual crimes over the last 18 months. I have been the recipient of a considerable amount of information from victims directly, much of which I have passed on to the police. You will know that some of this information has already led to arrests. I anticipate that, under your leadership, more work will follow.\nI enclose a contemporaneous note written by victim _________ of a rather blunt conversation she had with DCI Settle concerning his decision to drop the case. I invite you to note, in particular, that he told the victim - who had been locked in a flat and tried to escape from the bathroom window:\n\"There is no evidence he asked you for sex, forced you to have sex, or asked you to take off your clothes, which you did voluntarily\"\nThis was apparently considered to be a fatal deficiency. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the victim has not has this confirmed in writing as promised.\nI asked _______ to share her thoughts after her experience of reporting a crime. These are her words:\n\"My feelings are that I have been brutally misled having been encouraged by the DPP statements to come forward with my historical case following the Savile affair. All the public pronouncements after Savile suggested that these investigations would be treated sensitively, non-judgmentally and in a victim-centric way. I have been interviewed twice in long, harrowing video sessions first by ______ Police, then MPS [Metropolitan Police Service]. I have been encouraged by the MPS to believe that my evidence is both credible and corroborated. I have repeatedly had to relive the most harrowing night of my life, long pushed to the back of my mind. Then, when I had the temerity to question a police decision I have been turned on by a senior police officer, apparently with the support of the CPS. I have been implicitly accused of making an allegation against someone because 'it is all about who he is'. I have been implicitly accused of being a slut because I sat on a bed. These are attitudes that women of my generation associate with the police and prosecution authorities of the sixties and seventies, not an enlightened and publicly accountable twenty- first century service. It was these attitudes that made me think I would get nowhere if I proceeded with the case when the rape happened. It seems nothing has changed\". I have found myself appalled at the conduct of this investigation. I would like to believe that it is not typical of the CPS and Metropolitan police as a whole. However the case raises some very serious questions which are likely to remain unanswered without your attention.\nIn the light of this, please could you confirm to me that:\nEveryone is complicit in the failures of the past. But we have an opportunity now to put matters right. Any attempt to perpetuate a CPS in which a victim's acquiescence in or inability to escape rape is a barrier to prosecution would fail, with grievous consequences, and would be wrong.

{"document":"Philip Hammond says the extra money - to be phased in over three years - will help support a system that is \"clearly under pressure\".\nIt comes after months of warnings that services provided by councils for the elderly are under threat because of a lack of funding.\nThe numbers getting help in care homes and in their own homes for daily tasks such as washing and dressing have been falling in recent years.\nThis trend has been blamed for contributing to the growing pressures being seen in the NHS, particularly the rise in visits to A&E.\nSocial care chiefs have said they will need to spend nearly \u00a320bn on services this year.\nBut even when you take into account the extra money being raised from council tax increases and NHS money that is being transferred across, (both previous policy announcements to help out the sector) councils are still nearly \u00a31bn short of what they need.\nBy 2020 that funding gap is predicted to grow to \u00a32.6bn.\nThe money announced in the Budget will go some way to plugging that gap, but clearly not all the way.\nIt is expected to be phased in - with \u00a31bn coming next year and the remaining \u00a31bn spread out over the subsequent two.\nThis will go into a pot shared across both services for the elderly, and those provided to younger adults with disabilities.\nCharities have called it a \"sticking plaster\" to the wider problems facing the sector.\nAlthough, to be fair to the chancellor, he said the extra money would be followed by a green paper later in the year to overhaul the entire system, which has remained largely unchanged since it was created along with the NHS, after the Second World War.\nAbout 500,000 people in England pay the full cost of their care in England. This can prove very expensive.\nOne in 10 people face costs of over \u00a3100,000 once they pass the age of 65.\nAnd there is growing evidence these self-funders are helping to prop up the council-funded side of the market.\nAnalysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees councils pay care home firms are \u00a3100 a week below the actual cost of providing the care.\nIts researchers say this shortfall has effectively created a \"hidden care tax\" with self-funders now paying more than 25% extra for the same care.\nTo limit these costs the coalition government announced in 2013 it would be introducing a cap on the cost of care so no-one paid more than \u00a372,000 over their lifetime.\nThis was meant to be introduced in 2016, but that was delayed until 2020. The green paper that was announced in the Budget will set out how - indeed if - that policy will be incorporated into any future changes.\nBut the extra money will do nothing to help these people.\nMore than 4m people over the age of 65 have care needs, but only about 1.35m of them get formal care - either by paying for it themselves or relying on council help.\nWhat happens to the rest? There are 1.5m people who are cared for by family and friends and another 1.2m who struggle by with little or no help.\nIn theory councils could use the extra money to increase the number of people they help.\nBut given there's already a shortfall in funding to maintain the status quo, it seems doubtful this will happen.

{"document":"The 50-year-old from Felstead in Essex rowed the Atlantic two years ago in the Woodvale Challenge.\nThe 3,000-mile (4,800km) voyage took him 52 days - 10 of which were spent going backwards. Despite this, he set a new UK solo and race record.\nIn January, Mr Pitcher plans to do it all again. This time, he has his sights set on the 40-day trans-Atlantic solo rowing world record.\nHe will live aboard his rowing boat, the Soma of Essex. Made of carbon fibre, it is 6.5m (21ft) long and weighs just 460kg (1,014lb).\nEach day he will have to eat about 7,000 calories and make his own water to drink from sea water.\nAsked why he would row the Atlantic a second time, Mr Pitcher said: \"The first time, it was an adventure. I stumbled across that adventure and ended up rowing across the Atlantic in a race from the Canaries to Antigua.\n\"But we had very bad weather and it wasn't really what what I had bought into.\n\"When I got to Antigua I decided I wanted to do it again, hopefully with the right weather.\n\"I want to experience those famous trade winds which blow of the coast of Africa towards the Americas.\n\"Of course, I also want to try and break the world record to be the fastest solo rower across the Atlantic.\n\"Last time I spent 10 days going backwards and that is very mentally challenging,\" he said.\n\"But if we get good weather and  I don't go backwards for 10 days, I think there's a possibility of breaking the record.\"\nHis days will be divided into 16 hours of rowing, four hours sleeping and the remaining four hours will be spent on boat management.\nMr Pitcher will sleep on the floor of his compact cabin, which has a carbon fibre seat.\nFor entertainment, Mr Pitcher has a number of audio books to listen to and more than 4,000 songs on an iPod.

{"document":"Haig's side have won the past six European Nations Cup (ENC) titles - the division below the Six Nations - finished third in their 2015 World Cup pool and completed an unbeaten Pacific Islands tour this summer.\nThere is no imminent prospect of a change to the Six Nations format, despite alterations to rugby's international calendar after the 2019 World Cup.\nBut Haig believes the status quo is hampering Georgia's development, and their World Cup preparations.\n\"Absolutely, we've outgrown the ENC,\" Haig told BBC Scotland. \"You're not being disrespectful to the other teams - you're saying the obvious.\n\"That's why we've started being public about our desire to get into an expanded Six Nations. Not a promotion\/relegation system, that's never been our standpoint, it's always been that the Six Nations gets expanded to seven or eight teams, depending on what the current partners feel is applicable.\"\nThe New Zealander argues:\nAlmost every Tier Two nation agitates for more frequent fixtures against the Six Nations and Rugby Championship heavyweights, but Georgia's case for greater challenges is compelling.\nThe glaring extent of their supremacy in the ENC can be outlined thus: in the last six championships, they've lost just two matches from the 30 played. Their cumulative points difference reads: for 948, against 264.\nGeorgia have lost only once since last year's World Cup - a narrow defeat by Japan - and completed an unbeaten Pacific tour of Tonga, Fiji, and Samoa this summer. Last weekend, they beat the touring Samoans in Tbilisi.\nA Tier One nation has never played a Test in Georgia, and outside World Cup pool matches, their fixture with Scotland on 26 November will be only the fourth time in 13 years the Lelos have had the opportunity to pit themselves against top-class opposition.\n\"How can you improve [in that situation]? You can't,\" says Haig.\n\"The Test schedule for the Tier Ones is already done up to 2019, and the big boys sit around the table and work out a deal.\n\"Effectively there are a couple of weekends free to be filled with Tier Two teams. Then we go to a meeting, all the Tier Two guys go into a room and everybody scraps over what's left.\n\"We all have fisticuffs about who's getting what. I'm being facetious to some degree, but that's not too far away from what happens.\n\"It's not easy - that's the summary of that conversation. It's just not easy for Tier Two teams to get more than one or two Tests every year against Tier One teams.\n\"I'm not saying World Rugby doesn't look after us, they've been very good to us and helped us develop, but we need more.\n\"The challenge is that every Tier Two team says they want more, but it's how you prioritise that that's going to be key.\"\nAlterations to the present Six Nations format have long been mooted - outgoing World Rugby president Bernard Lapasset called for a promotion\/relegation play-off, with the ENC winners playing the team that finishes bottom in the Six Nations, as he left office in April.\nThat seems a fair proposal on the face of it, but Haig says Georgia have to be cannier in their demands.\n\"The reality is, if you were one of those six partners, not one would want to put their seat in jeopardy, and if it was me sitting in their position, I wouldn't either,\" says the New Zealander.\n\"But if you go to the negotiating table and don't have any cards to play, you've then got to say, 'there's no threat here of anybody losing their seat, all we're asking for is you put one more seat at the table'.\n\"I think for us, that's the smarter way to go. It's also less threatening to the existing partners and it means they're helping to grow the game in eastern Europe.\n\"There's a massive potential market in eastern Europe, and we would say by including Georgia, or Romania or Russia, you might be able to capitalise on that.\"\nThe prospect of a global season, a closer alignment of the northern and southern hemisphere calendars, has been hotly debated, but Haig fears that scenario would only condense the international windows, and thereby reduce the already scant opportunities for Georgia to take on the \"big boys\".\n\"We feel if we can't get World Rugby giving us more Tier One Tests, then the obvious solution would be for us to be included in an expanded Six Nations,\" he says.\n\"Automatically, you get six more Tier One games. And it wouldn't have to go outside the current Test windows.\n\"It would fit into both our calendar and the Six Nations calendar. Nothing has to change, apart from the fact we'd get much better rugby.\n\"And with much better rugby consistently, we'd perform better at a World Cup. That's where we see our future, and that's where we'll keep having those conversations.\"\nDomestically, there is broad scope for growth. Georgia, says Haig, is a nation where rugby is on a rapid upward trajectory, and sell-out Tbilisi crowds of 50,000-plus for ENC fixtures are the norm.\nBut in his 30-man November squad, over half play their club rugby in France or England, rather than the semi-professional Georgian leagues.\nMeanwhile, as they seek innovative methods to combat Anglo-French wealth, the Pro12 league's representatives have been exploring opportunities to incorporate North American teams or franchises.\nThe New Zealander says they've made enquiries with the Georgian union too - and those enquiries are most welcome.\n\"Our union has been approached by the Pro12 - it was just the initial discussions, but we've indicated that absolutely we'd love to have a team in that competition,\" he says.\n\"We're trying to put our players, whether at international or local level, into better competitions, so that they learn the game and get better.\n\"It's a pathway for our younger players as well. To have a fully professional team in a competition like that, would do us wonders.\n\"That's an obvious step that we'd like to continue conversations so that hopefully we can within a couple of years get that up and running.\"\nThe Georgian game has one vital fillip, absent from many of its Tier Two counterparts, that may help smooth its ascent - money.\nWhere the Pacific teams of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga are hampered by modest revenue and ramshackle infrastructure, Georgian rugby is bankrolled by former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili.\nForbes Magazine puts Ivanishvili's net worth at $4.8bn (\u00a33.89bn). That's over $1bn more than US president-elect Donald Trump ($3.7bn), and just shy of Richard Branson ($4.9bn).\nIn almost five years as head coach, Haig has never actually met the man whose wealth is propelling his vision, but its impact is apparent everywhere.\n\"When I first came here and saw our high-performance base, not even New Zealand had something like that, and probably still doesn't,\" says Haig.\n\"We have our own 27-room hotel, swimming pool, commercial kitchen, gymnasium, grandstand, one artificial field, one natural field, fully-lit to international standards.\n\"It's incredible what we've got here, and we've continued to improve our high-performance centre.\n\"We've just built a 14x14m fully-covered wrestling dojo that we do a lot of our contact work in.\n\"Prior to the World Cup, I said, it'd be great if we had this, because it'll help us get better, and bang - it was built in 10 minutes. When you have the ability to do that, it helps everything we're doing.\n\"He's not at all a rugby fanatic. He's a very private man. He understands what rugby's doing for the country and the people, and that's why he's happy to invest in the infrastructure, and our day-to-day costs are always covered by the government.\n\"If we've got the opportunity to be sitting at that Six Nations table, it becomes a whole different landscape for Georgian rugby.\n\"And I'd be pretty confident that whatever was necessary in terms of funding or building more infrastructure, he'd be the first to put his hand up and say, yes, we can do that.\"\nHaig remains upbeat that as he continues to add tactical nous, game understanding and more polished skill-sets to the historically formidable physical profile of the Georgian squad, and its momentum continues to snowball, there is light at the end of the tunnel.\nHe sees parallels with Argentina, whose case for top-tier rugby eventually grew so irrefutable that they were invited to join the Rugby Championship in 2012 and Super Rugby in 2016, with most of their Test squad contracted to Buenos Aires-based franchise, the Jaguares.\nAnd Haig is increasingly reassured by what he perceives to be a change in attitude among the powers-that-be - he says the notion of a bigger Six Nations no longer seems so distant.\n\"Rugby in Georgia just keeps growing,\" says Haig. \"Player numbers for kids are growing; it's getting bigger and bigger.\n\"As we build more infrastructure throughout the country, more stadiums, more fields, it's the old adage - if you build it, they will come, and that's been the mantra for us.\n\"If one of those top nations came to Georgia to play, I can guarantee you we'd be packing out the biggest stadium in Georgia, and it'd be an atmosphere they maybe hadn't experienced for some time.\n\"I understand that London, Paris, Rome, are all very nice places, but again I think if you are a touring team or tourist coming to play or watch a game in Tbilisi will be an experience you probably haven't had before.\n\"We're certainly pretty confident within the next four or five years, it's going to happen.\n\"And the first time it does, it's going to be a big occasion for the country. That's what we keep holding onto - that one day, it's going to happen, and for our country that'll be awesome.\"","summary":"Georgia head coach Milton Haig believes his side merit a place in an expanded Six Nations Championship, and says Tier Two nations are \"fighting for scraps\" in the battle to earn fixtures against top opposition.","id":38030651}

I believe this nation needs a wartime president to defend it.\"\nThe Texas senator then pitched the audience of Republican Jewish activists and deep-pocketed conservative donors on why he's the man for the job.\nAs he did in last month's Republican presidential debate, he chided President Barack Obama for not using the term \"radical Islamic terrorism\".\nA president, he said, must speak the truth. \"When the president stands up and says the Islamic State isn't Islamic - that's just nutty,\" he said, calling Mr Obama an apologist for \"radical Islamic terrorism\".\nHe said as president he would make sure the US does more to stand by its allies - Israel in particular - and defeat its enemies.\n\"If you are voting for Hillary Clinton,\" he said, \"you are voting for the Ayatollah Khamenei to have a nuclear device.\"","summary":"Republican presidential candidates speaking at a forum in Washington, DC, have responded to the mass shooting in California which left at least 14 dead.","id":34998776}

{"document":"After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.\nAlthough many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.\nExtend, yes, but for just one more year.\nSuperficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.\nDid Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?\nWas he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?\nOr was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?\nThe third, it appears, was the clincher.\nWhen Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to \"taking an egg out of omelette\"), was a remote one.\nBut that all changed on 23 June.\nBeyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.\nIf he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.\nShould he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?\nThat might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.\nAnd the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he \"wanted to serve\" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.\nBut, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a \"third way\" - the short extension.\nThe reasons were personal and unique.\nIn 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.\nLike everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.\nFor his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.\nHe hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.\n\"To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,\" he said about whether he would extend his stay.\n\"No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.\n\"Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.\"\nThose around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of \"tension\" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.\nNeither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.\nProfessionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.\nBut, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.\nBy then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","summary":"Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one.","id":37838086}

He had dismissed the previous attorney general after he repeatedly criticised the prime minister's handling of the case.\nThe current attorney general, Mohamed Apandi, said on Thursday that there was no evidence funds were misappropriated from 1MDB.\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Najib stressed the US case was a \"civil, not a criminal, procedure\" and that \"we don't want to come to any conclusions until that process [the investigation] is done\".\n\"I want to say categorically that we are serious about good governance,\" he said, adding that he would \"fully co-operate\" with the investigation.\nDespite denying any wrongdoing, the prime minister is now facing renewed calls to answer the accusations and stand down.\nFormer premier and long-time Najib foe Mahathir Mohamad said there \"can be no doubt\" that Mr Najib was responsible for 1MDB's finances.\nHe said Malaysians should stage street protests against Mr Najib, as they have in the past, and push for a referendum on his leadership.\nParliamentary opposition leader Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said he should go on leave \"so as not to create the perception of abuse of power\" or hinder this \"very important\" investigation.\nWhen I spoke to the fund's CEO, Arul Kanda, in October last year, he told me \"the value of assets outweigh the value of debt\".\nBut 1MDB had to sell some of its most prized assets in order to realise this value, and as one Malaysian opposition leader put it to me at the time, any business that has to do that isn't a successful business.\n1MDB's financial mismanagement and the allegations of misconduct by the prime minister has raised concern amongst the foreign investment community that Malaysia's economy is in for a rough ride.\nBut there are bigger worries than just the financial performance of 1MDB. At the heart of it is the suggestion that Malaysia's public money has been stolen and used for personal gain.\nRead more from Karishma\n1MDB said in a statement last year that it had never given money to the prime minister and called the claims \"unsubstantiated\".\nMeanwhile Singapore fraud investigators said on Thursday they had seized more than $175m in assets connected to 1MDB and found several major banks, including Standard Chartered, had showed \"weaknesses in the processes for accepting clients and monitoring transactions\".\nAlso on Thursday, the Swiss authorities said they had seized three valuable paintings linked to the investigation - one Van Gogh painting and two Monet paintings, following a US request.","summary":"Malaysian PM Najib Razak is facing pressure internationally and at home amid US allegations of massive fraud at state investment fund 1MDB.","id":36852560}

Let it come to an end.\"\nThe barrister also confirmed plans to pursue all four men now held liable for the bombing.\nTo date, no-one has been successfully criminally prosecuted for the bombing.\nIn the absence of criminal convictions, the victims' families took a landmark civil action, seeking damages from the men they believed were responsible.\nThe retrial followed the original Omagh bomb civil case, which is believed to be the first time anywhere in the world that alleged members of a terrorist organisation have been sued.\nThe first trial concluded in June 2009, when a judge ruled that four men - Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly - were all responsible for carrying out the atrocity.\nThe 12 relatives who had taken the action were awarded more than \u00a31.6m in damages.\nMr McCombe said the families had not received \"one single penny\" from that judgement.\nHowever, the four men who were found liable subsequently launched appeals.\nMichael McKevitt and Liam Campbell failed to have the civil judgement against them overturned two years later.\nColm Murphy and Seamus Daly were successful in upholding their appeals in July 2011, but the pair were then ordered to face a retrial of the civil case.\nMr Murphy a Dundalk-based publican and contractor, and former employee Seamus Daly, from Cullaville, County Monaghan, denied playing central roles in the atrocity.","summary":"Two men who were sued over the Omagh bomb have been found liable for the 1998 atrocity at their civil retrial.","id":21858904}

{"document":"Elderly World War Two veterans lead the crowd. And many of the participants are carrying flowers to lay at the Freedom Monument, Latvia's symbol of national independence.\nThey have come here to commemorate those who died defending Latvia against the Soviet Union in the war.\nBut with Russian troops now in nearby Ukraine, many in the Baltics are alarmed that history may be about to repeat itself.\n\"If Ukraine falls, then Russian ambitions won't stop with this. I believe we will be next in Russia's list of actions,\" said one young man who had come to take part in the procession.\n\"It shows the attitude of Russia - how it goes into another country very easily and acts in an aggressive manner,\" said another.\nBut this annual memorial service is highly controversial. These elderly veterans fought against Russia - but for Nazi Germany.\nThe Baltics have spent much of their history being buffeted between neighbouring imperial forces.\nAnd in WWII, having already suffered severe oppression under Stalin, many Latvians saw Hitler's forces as the lesser of two evils - Latvia's only chance of not slipping back into Stalinist oppression.\nBut the veterans and their supporters are accused of being Nazi sympathisers - particularly by Latvia's large Russian-speaking community.\nAbout 1,000 Russian-speakers have gathered behind police barricades near the monument to protest. \"Fascists go home!\" shout some. \"Shame! Shame!\" shout others.\nThis year security is particularly tight, with as many police officers as participants, amid fears that the instability in Ukraine will spark ethnic tensions here.\nIt is a similar dynamic to Ukraine: pro-Moscow local Russian-speakers accusing pro-Western nationalists of being right-wing extremists. And like Ukraine, some Russian-speakers here say they are discriminated against by mainstream society.\n\"I feel like a person who is second-class,\" says Aleksandr Gaponenko, a Russian-speaker who moved to Soviet-era Latvia with his parents 59 years ago, when he was a one-year-old.\n\"We want equal rights for our languages, and we want equal social and economic rights.\"\nLatvia country profile\nAccording to the Latvian authorities, throughout the 20th Century people from elsewhere in the USSR were resettled in the Baltics as a deliberate Soviet policy to water down Baltic culture and destroy local national sentiment.\nAnd still today Russian-speakers are sometimes pejoratively called \"occupiers\".\nSo when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Mr Gaponenko, like many Russians, was not automatically granted Latvian citizenship, and lost his job in Riga city council.\nToday he is classed as a \"non-citizen\" - which means he is still not allowed to work for the state and does not have the right to vote.\nAround 300,000 Russian-speakers, or 13% of Latvia's population, are so-called \"non-citizens\". And they live in an EU member state and member of Nato.\nTo become Latvian, they have to prove their knowledge of the Latvian language and culture in a citizenship test - even if they were born here.\nSome Russian-speakers, such as Mr Gaponenko, refuse to take the test, saying that the country where they have spent all their lives should grant them citizenship automatically.\nOthers, particularly older people, say they do not speak Latvian well enough to pass the test.\nBut the Latvian government says it is encouraging all residents of Latvia to become citizens. And it accuses the Kremlin of using the issue to stir up resentment within the local Russian-speaking population and create political instability.\n\"There's massive propaganda, even an information warfare - not only here, and not only using Russian-speaking media, but also using other channels,\" says Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics.\nRussian-speakers often live very separate lives from their Latvian neighbours, living in different neighbourhoods, often socialising in different places.\nIn Riga city centre, one bar might be full of local Russian-speakers, next door packed with ethnic Latvians.\nEstimates of numbers of Russian-speakers vary. According to Latvian pollster SKDS, Russian-speakers make up 42% of the population in Latvia, with 58% described as ethnic Latvian.\nThis split in society is exacerbated by the political system.\nThe parties popular with ethnic Latvian voters manage to form convoluted governing coalitions to stay in power. Meanwhile Harmony Centre, a party voted for mainly by Russians-speakers, is stuck in opposition - despite having won more votes than any other single party in the last parliamentary elections of 2011.\nMost problematic, says political analyst and pollster Arnis Kaktins, is that Russian-speakers often consume all their news from media produced in Moscow, while ethnic Latvians tend to get their information from Latvian or Western news outlets.\nSo the two communities are developing opposing views about who is to blame for the crisis in Ukraine.\n\"When so many people rely heavily on Russian news sources, it means that Russia has an instrument to change their minds if it would like to,\" says Mr Kaktins.\nThere is a fear that the Kremlin could encourage Latvia's predominantly Russian-speaking border regions to follow Crimea's example and break away from Latvia to join Russia.\nAll three Baltic States are in Nato, so it is seen as unlikely that the Kremlin would send in troops, and start a conflict that the West would feel obliged to respond to militarily.\nThe real worry is that the crisis could increase divisions within Latvian society.\nSince independence in 1991, Latvia's two communities have lived side-by-side peacefully.\nBut if the conflict in Ukraine gets worse, the rift could grow between Russian-speakers who support Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and ethnic Latvians who support the West.","summary":"A mournful procession of about 1,500 Latvians winds its way through Riga's medieval Old Town singing traditional Latvian songs.","id":26720549}

{"document":"One of their own was coming home to be given the freedom of the burgh after achieving what was something akin to the moon landing of its time.\nCaptain James Anderson, by then Sir James Anderson, was in command of the ship which laid a telegraph cable under the Atlantic.\nOn 14 December 1866, his fellow Doonhamers put on a banquet worthy of such a significant achievement.\nThe menu for the 200 invited guests at the Assembly Rooms was of a quality - and scale - reserved for only the most special occasions.\n\"The dinner was plentiful, rich and well diversified,\" reported the Dumfries and Galloway Standard.\n\"The bill of fare including four kinds of soup, as many varieties of fish, a haunch of venison, roasts of beef, braised beef, mutton roast and boiled, pigeon pies, venison pasties, rabbit curries, chicken curries, cutlets, blackgame, grouse, pheasants, woodcocks and many other articles.\n\"A second course followed of puddings, souffles, mince pies, tarts, creams, jellies, blancmanges, trifles and other pastry.\n\"The wines supplied were champagne, hock, port and sherry.\"\nIt crowned an incredible journey for a boy born in south west Scotland with a passion for the sea.\nDumfries and Galloway Council archivist Graham Roberts explained: \"He was born in 1824, he was the son of a bookseller who had a shop on the High Street near the top of the vennel, John Anderson.\n\"He was the fourth son - so he wasn't going to go into the family business.\n\"He had a brief apprenticeship as a printer - he got totally fed up and said he wanted to go to sea.\"\nA passion - and aptitude - for being out on the water had been with him since his time as a schoolboy in the town.\n\"It was when he was at the Academy that he entered the Dumfries regatta but he didn't have a boat,\" explained Mr Roberts.\n\"All he had was a tin tub - which became known as Anderson's canister - and he still won the race.\"\nHis family, somewhat reluctantly, eventually allowed him to join T&J Brocklebank in Whitehaven where his career went from strength to strength.\nHis abilities as a navigator and a leader were quickly recognised.\n\"He shot through the ranks and became a master of a ship in his early 20s and by the 1840s or 1850s he was basically head hunted,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"You didn't go from sail to steam but he did and the steam ships were the biggest.\"\nBefore he reached 40, he was put in charge of the biggest of them all.\n\"In 1862 or 1863 he was head hunted to be captain of the Great Eastern where they were trying to lay the Transatlantic Cable,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"The Great Eastern was five times bigger than any ship there had ever been before that.\n\"It remained the biggest ship until the series of ships which included the Titanic.\n\"When you were captaining that ship it wasn't just a small step up navigationally - it was very hard to manoeuvre it.\"\nAnd yet Anderson seemed to have the skills required.\n\"A lot of people who knew him remarked on his calmness,\" said Mr Roberts.\nBill Burns, who runs the History of the Atlantic Cable and Undersea Communications website, said Anderson was a remarkable individual involved in one of the biggest logistical operations of the day.\n\"After the partial success of the Atlantic cable in 1858, which proved the feasibility of the project, the 1865 and 1866 expeditions were without doubt the most significant events in the industry's history up until that time and for many years to come,\" he said.\n\"The Atlantic cable route, as it remains today with multiple fibre optic lines, was the most important in the world for trade, finance, and government.\"\nMr Burns said the successful completion of the project - which cost the equivalent of $100m in today's money - was the responsibility of Samuel Canning, the engineer in charge of the expedition.\nHowever, he said that Anderson, as the captain, had \"many additional responsibilities\" to ensure the success of the operation, including directing the complex manoeuvring of the ship required when laying and recovering cables at great depth.\n\"Add to that the fact that Anderson was at the helm of the Great Eastern (the largest ship ever built at that time and for many years after), which had already survived many disasters and had bankrupted its owners, and you can understand that he was no ordinary captain,\" he said.\nHis first attempt to lay the cable would test his abilities to the full.\n\"In 1865, everything that could go wrong did go wrong - they actually feared sabotage at the time,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"They were very worried there was some saboteur on board from some rival firm.\"\nThat mission ended in failure, with the cable lost, but the story had gripped the nation.\n\"Because they were laying the cable they could still keep in communication with the mainland and the reports were constantly in the papers,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"When they came back instead of being treated as losers they were treated as heroes.\"\nIt prompted a big effort for a renewed attempt in 1866.\n\"It was world news - it was the first time that a really long cable was being laid under sea,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"This was far, far bigger than anything before and they had so many challenges.\n\"Everybody knew that if they could do that then the whole world would be linked up.\n\"We had the railway age in the 1840s - this was the big thing, it was really the story of the 1860s in technical terms.\"\nThe tale of the journey from Valentia Island, one of Ireland's most westerly points, to Heart's Content, Newfoundland generated huge interest.\nNot only was the 1866 attempt successful, they were also able to pick up the lost cable from the previous year and complete two telegraph links under the ocean.\nAnderson's part in the mission, the brainchild of American businessman Cyrus Field, brought him both recognition and proved to have a profitable side.\nHe was seen as the ideal person to be a director of a large number of telegraph companies, including the firm that would eventually become Cable and Wireless.\nHe was honoured by Queen Victoria but recognition in his hometown still meant a lot to him.\n\"I should like to let you know, if I only could, how deeply I feel this your kindness,\" he said.\n\"I know very well that as long as my life lasts, I shall remember it, and shall do nothing to forfeit the kindness and praise which you have now bestowed upon me.\"\nAlthough he lived in London by this time, he still had a soft spot for south west Scotland making regular trips back home.\n\"He built the house at Kirkconnel Lea near Glencaple in 1872, that was his fun place,\" said Mr Roberts. \"He also came back to give talks.\"\nHis death, in May 1893, was the subject of a large obituary in the local papers and his body was brought back to Dumfries for burial in St Mary's churchyard.\n\"In his death, Dumfries has to mourn the loss of a distinguished and devoted son,\" wrote the Dumfries and Galloway Standard.\n\"His life-story, moreover, is an instructive illustration of the possibilities that wait on persevering, self-reliant, and intelligently directed effort.\"\nNot bad for a boy who once had to work overtime to save up the money needed to buy a metal \"tub\" to race in a regatta.\nA special display about Sir James Anderson is going up in the archives and local studies section of the Ewart Library in Dumfries starting on Thursday 15 December.","summary":"The people of Dumfries were in a mood to celebrate 150 years ago.","id":38025397}

{"document":"Thousands more had official guest status and got a slightly closer view from inside the spaceport itself. A magnificent morning ascent for the youngest of the Nasa spaceplanes as it began its final mission - the delivery of the $2bn Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) instrument to the International Space Station.\nThere will, however, be a group of British engineers for whom Monday's lift-off was a bitter-sweet moment. These are the people whose technology got dropped from AMS in the year before launch.\nFor those not familiar with this story, let me back up and reprise events. They have some potentially fascinating implications for deep space travel.\nAMS is one of the most expensive science experiments ever put in space - probably the most expensive.\nIt has taken a group of 600 or so researchers from 16 nations a total of 17 years to prepare it for flight. It promises some dramatic new insights into the origin and make-up of the cosmos.\nAMS will do this by studying the storm of high-energy particles (cosmic rays) that are hurled at Earth from the deepest reaches of the Universe.\nCritical to its operation is a very strong magnet. As the particles enter AMS, they will bend through this magnet. How they bend reveals their charge, a fundamental property that says a great deal about the nature of those particles and where they came from.\nThe UK at a programmatic level never got involved in AMS, presumably because it was a space station project (and the UK doesn't engage with human spaceflight), but one British company was contracted to build the all-important magnet.\nScientific Magnetics (formerly Space Cryomagnetics) of Culham, in Oxfordshire, spent 12 years developing this super-cooled beast, and it was - so the project leaders on AMS told me - a marvel.\nIt was incredibly powerful and directed its entire field inwards, like an enclosed bubble. From the outside, the magnet appeared as an inert beer can.\nThis was really important because if you put such a device on a shuttle or a space station and it hasn't been carefully designed, it will start to interact with its surrounding - even try to orientate itself with the Earth's magnetic field. Not what you want on a space vehicle.\nBut to cut a long story short, the British magnet's super-fluid-helium cooling mechanism meant that it was only ever going to be a short-lived device. And when the space station's life was extended last year to 2020, the AMS project leaders took the decision to remove the UK magnet and replace it with a less powerful, but much longer-lived, Chinese one.\nNow, as I say, this is a story with some interesting outcomes.\nThe British magnet is currently sitting in store at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern) where AMS was assembled and tested, and there's a lot of interest in seeing its technology put to other uses.\nThe first of these is astronaut protection. The cosmic rays that AMS is trying to characterise are particles that also represent a hazard to humans in space.\nWhen astronauts eventually go beyond the space station - back to the Moon, and on to asteroids and Mars - they will need to shield themselves from these high-energy particles. The idea of using a powerful magnetic field to do this job is being investigated Dr Roberto Battiston, the deputy principal investigator on AMS. He told me:\n\"We continue to work to understand how this technology could be used for future shielding of astronauts undergoing long exposure, for instance at a Moonbase or on a trip to Mars\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 because this is by far the most advanced super-conducting magnet-design ever built and completed for a space mission. It is not going to fly but it had everything that would allow it to fly.\n\"The European Space Agency asked me to submit a proposal for a feasibility study and [Scientific Magnetics] is part of it.\n\"We would design the magnet in a different way to the AMS one.  AMS was designed to have a very strong magnetic field within an inner bore. By modifying the coils and the currents, we can design a magnetic field confined in an external ring surrounding an inner bore that is magnetic-field free. In this internal module will be the habitable part for the astronauts - where they will live. We are talking about something having a diameter of about five to six metres and the length of 10m - surrounded by this magnetic field that is intense enough to bend away cosmic rays coming from deep space.\"\nThere are immense practicalities to overcome, of course. These special magnets get their strength because they are superconducting. This means running them at cryo-temperatures, which demands a lot of liquid helium.\nThis has a tendency to boil off over time, limiting the life of your device, which brings us back to AMS. All that said, Professor Battiston is encouraged by the research. He says it should be possible to limit radiation exposure on a Mars flight to something similar to that currently experienced by astronauts on a six-month stay at the space station.\nThe other big space application for which British magnet technology might be useful is in the plasma rockets that could one day propel all spacecraft.\nThese rely on the motion of highly excited gases, or plasmas, moulded by magnetic fields to provide thrust. Although they don't give the initial big kick you get from chemical combustion, their supreme efficiency means they can go on thrusting for extended periods, achieving far more acceleration per kilogram of fuel consumed. Proponents of plasma rockets say they could dramatically cut the journey time to Mars from months to weeks.\nScientific Magnetics has already produced a superconducting magnet for a testbed at Ad Astra in Texas, the company at the forefront of this propulsion technology.\nSteve Harrison from Scientific Magnetics told me:\n\"These rockets use radio frequency heating to generate the plasma and then the magnets contain the plasma in the same way they do in a tokomak fusion reactor. The magnets are profiled such that they form a sort of nozzle out the back; and because the plasma is expanding and supersonic, it flies out and gives you thrust. For the system Ad Astra has been testing for the last two years, we designed and built the super-conducting magnet.\"\nSimilar obstacles to the magnetic shield prevent immediate adoption of the propulsion application as well, especially if the propulsion magnets incorporate cryogenic liquids, but both concepts are definitely worth watching for the future.","summary":"It's thought as many as half a million people crammed the roads and beaches outside the Kennedy Space Center to see Endeavour's final launch.","id":13411163}

{"document":"The pictures show the swirling clouds of the gas giant at both its poles - views that no previous mission has managed to acquire in such detail.\nJuno captured the data last weekend as it made its first close approach to the planet since going into orbit in July.\nThe flyby took the spacecraft just 4,200km above Jupiter's multi-coloured atmosphere.\nThe 6MB of data downlinked to Earth from the encounter is still being analysed, but principal investigator Scott Bolton said new things were already obvious.\n\"First glimpse of Jupiter's north pole, and it looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before. It's bluer in colour up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms,\" the Southwest Research Institute scientist explained in a Nasa statement.\n\"There is no sign of the latitudinal bands or zones and belts that we are used to - this image is hardly recognisable as Jupiter.\n\"We're seeing signs that the clouds have shadows, possibly indicating that the clouds are at a higher altitude than other features.\"\nJonathan Nichols from the University of Leicester, UK, is a member of the Juno mission's science team.\nHe told the BBC that his colleagues were bowled over when they first saw the pictures: \"The team's reaction was amazement. 'Look at these images; they are coming from Jupiter; we're flying over the pole for the first time!' It's just jaw-dropping.\"\nWhen the Juno probe arrived at Jupiter in July, its instruments and camera were switched off.\nIt had to perform a critical rocket manoeuvre to get into orbit - and engineers did not want the complication of taking pretty pictures at the same time. But after successfully turning around the planet, Juno booted up its other systems, and last Saturday's return pass was the first opportunity to get a good look at the gaseous world.\nThe probe's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) has acquired unique views of Jupiter's southern aurora.\nEarth telescopes have tried but failed to get such images.\nAnd Juno's Radio\/Plasma Wave Experiment (Waves) has recorded the blizzard of particles moving through the planet's super-strong magnetic field.\nJuno's quest is to investigate the secrets of the Solar System by explaining the origin and evolution of its biggest planet.\nThe spacecraft's remote sensing instruments will look down into the giant's many layers and measure their composition, temperature, motion and other properties.\nWe should finally discover whether Jupiter has a solid core or if its gas merely compresses to an ever denser state all the way to the centre.\nWe will also get new information on the famous Great Red Spot - the colossal storm that has raged on Jupiter for hundreds of years. Juno will tell us how deep its roots go.\nAnd Dr Nichols said Jupiter was a wonderful laboratory to try to understand even more distant places.\n\"We can go to Jupiter and kick the tyres to see how it works, but that then gives us some insights on lots of other objects in the Universe.\n\"We can use Jupiter as an analogue for things like brown dwarfs and exoplanets - basically, any fast-rotating body with a magnetic field can be modelled in some way like Jupiter.\"\nThe spacecraft is currently flying on an ellipse around Jupiter that takes 53 days to complete. Its next close approach is due on 19 October, when the probe will fire its main engine to tighten the circuit to just 14 days.\nThis configuration will then be held until February 2018 when the spacecraft will be commanded to make a destructive dive into Jupiter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere.\nBy that stage, however, scientists hope to have built a formidable data-set to help answer their most pressing questions about this vast world.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos","summary":"The US space agency (Nasa) has released spectacular new images of Jupiter acquired by its Juno probe.","id":37259937}

{"document":"How a winemaker is taking on Sicily's rural Mafia\nIt's a warm July evening and the surrounding hills glow golden in the setting sun amid the chirruping of swallows and the song of cicadas.\nIt should be an image of rural peace and contentment, but on closer inspection, all is not quite as it seems.\nSecurity cameras on high stilts dot the perimeter of his land. The metal gates leading into his winery remain securely shut throughout our interview, and inside the winery's main building, images from across his vineyard flicker on a bank of screens.\nThis, he says, is what it takes to run a modern business in Sicily in 2017.\nCesare has been threatened, his land has been repeatedly trespassed on, his buildings have been damaged and trees cut down or set alight. He's even been physically attacked.\n\"The rural Mafia was trying to drive us off our land and destroy our business,\" he says between careful sips of wine.\nSo who are the rural Mafia? Well, they're shepherds in the main - but some officials believe they're acting in cahoots with local lawyers, accountants and possibly even local politicians.\nCesare believes the battle against them pits modern Italy against forces that want Sicily to remain rooted in the ways of the past.\nDriving out of his winery, he points out wooden stakes in the ground. \"See that?\" he says. \"They're the signs of the rural Mafia\"\nThe stakes are dotted across the land around his vineyard. They're about a metre-long, distinctive for the strip of white cardboard wrapped round them.\nAnd they're a common sight in rural Sicily.\nThere are more about 100km (60 miles) away from Cesare's winery, in the foothills of Mount Etna, where Sebastiano Blanco is rebuilding a house on his plot of land.\n\"What those stakes say is 'this land belongs to us',\" Sebastiano says. \"They, the rural Mafia, see all this land as their own, regardless of who has legal title to it.\"\nLike Cesare, he says there are local clans who believe that they, and not the Italian state, set the laws.\nLast year, Sebastiano's house was burnt down. The police and fire brigade said the fire was probably started by a homeless person who'd come inside to warm up.\nBut Sebastiano thinks it's no coincidence that the fire happened soon after stakes appeared on his land. He believes the rural Mafia took revenge when he wouldn't hand over his land.\nHe cuts a forlorn figure, kicking at the blackened rubble strewn across the charred ground of what were once his bedroom, with the early evening's purple sky visible through the exposed beams of his shattered roof.\nSo, what exactly is it that the Mafia wants?\nGiuseppe Antoci, president of Sicily's largest national park, Nebrodi, and co-ordinator of Federparchi Sicilia, the Federation of Sicilian National Parks, has been investigating the matter for the past few years.\nWhat he's uncovered is widespread fraud involving European Union farm and rural development funds.\nIn an investigation conducted together with the deputy police commissioner Daniele Manganaro of the district of Messina, Mr Antoci found that local crime networks were falsely claiming land as their own - or presenting forged documents saying they had leased it - in order to make applications for EU subsidies.\n\"We've seen an evolution of Mafia here,\" he says.\n\"This is not the Mafia of the illegal drugs trade or the trafficking of arms. It takes a lot of work and research to commit this sort of fraud. We're not talking about the Mafia that existed 30 years ago, where the shepherd demanded a ransom or protection payment from a tradesman.\n\"What we have here is a Mafia whose business is to commit fraud with EU funds. And to carry out this sort of fraud, you need more than just a shepherd.\n\"What it requires is a network of people, people with schooling and education, people who know how the system works, because the first step in perpetrating this sort of fraud is to set up a company,\" says the police commissioner.\nMr Antoci has tried to put a stop to it.\nHe's set in motion a new law that states that anyone claiming EU subsidies on land must now show anti-Mafia certification. In Italy, this means complying with regulations that require that a company's shareholders and directors have no restrictions, limitations and bans according to anti-mafia regulations.\nSceptics say this is hardly enough to stop the fraud from being repeated, pointing out that many will simply make use of proxies to make claims on their behalf.\nThe European Union's anti-fraud office, Olaf, says it is reviewing 35,000 applications for agricultural subsidies in Italy covering some 500m euros in disbursements going back all the way to 2006.\nIt has also started nine criminal proceedings, all of which involve a network of organised crime. But this 500m euros (\u00c2\u00a3447m) that the EU is looking into is far less than the 3.5bn euros that Mr Antoci and the local police force say may have been fraudulently claimed.\n\"I can tell you that there is a very strong commitment at the level of the EU as well as the level of national authorities to fight this kind of phenomenon,\" says Francesco Albore, the head of the Olaf unit investigating the matter.\nAnother 2.2bn euros have been earmarked in EU and Italian government funds for rural and agricultural development in the six years to 2020. So what guarantees are there that all those funds will be properly distributed?\nMr Albore says it's difficult to guarantee but points out the EU also demands guarantees that payments go to the correct recipients. Where this is not the case, he says, \"payments can be stopped.\"\nMeanwhile, back in Sicily, Mr Antoci's efforts to fight this fraud have come at a high personal price.\nHe's suffered death threats and now lives under permanent armed guard.\nLast year, as he was being driven home through the Nebrodi national park following a late night dinner, his car came under a volley of gunfire.\nIf he's alive today, he says, it's only thanks to his armed guard and the fact that his car was being followed by that of the deputy police commissioner Daniele Manganaro who managed to scupper the attack by firing back.\nIn the aftermath, there were attempts to discredit his investigation. Some Italian media reports questioned the authenticity of the attack, suggesting Mr Antoci and the local police force had made it up. But it's only made him more determined.\n\"You know, afterwards, they found petrol bombs hidden in nearby bushes,\" Mr Antoci says. \"They wanted me dead. But my first thought as I was being saved that night was for my family and for all the police officers who guard me - the sacrifices they have to make for this battle I've chosen to wage.\"\nStill, one businessman I speak to, who's been subjected to similar threats for not handing over land, complains that he's had little support from local Sicilian political authorities in his fight to protect his land.\nWhich is why, back in the foothills of Mount Etna, Sebastiano Blanco wears a T-shirt emblazoned with the words: \"Rural mafia - a protected species\".\n\"It's 2017,\" he says. \"How can this be happening in our day and age?\"\nHe gestures at the smoking volcano, looming large in the distance over his land.\n\"This is a Unesco world heritage site,\" he says. \"But as long as we're intimidated this way, how can we possibly build on the economic value of our land and property?\"\nIn collaboration with Diego Gandolfo and Alessandro di Nunzio\nListen to more from BBC World Service's Business Daily programme here","summary":"From the terrace of his winery near the baroque town of Caltagirone in south-eastern Sicily, Cesare Nicodemo surveys his fields of ripening vines - a glass of his finest spumante in hand.","id":40645146}

John, my caddie and I kept communication great. We talked it out and got back to hitting the fairways and doing the basics and that led to some birdies on the front nine.

He signed for three birdies and two bogeys to finish three under, alongside 2014 US Open winner Martin Kaymer (69) and Austria's Bernd Wiesberger (72).\nAmerican Jordan Spieth, winner in 2015, birdied two of his first four holes to get to one under but a bogey on the sixth checked his progress as he posted a one-under 71 to move to level par.\nWith the cut coming at one over, the joint-lowest 36-hole mark in US Open history, the 68 players who will contest the final two rounds are all within eight shots of the lead - the same number of shots Matsuyama made up on playing partner Fowler in round two.\nOlympic champion Justin Rose is another who will be heading home early after carding a two-over 74.

{"document":"Qualification for France looks little more than a formality from a favourable group that offered England and manager Roy Hodgson the perfect rehabilitation period after their embarrassing early retreat from South America at the group stage.\nThe thrilling victory against Slovenia in Ljubljana on Sunday made it six wins out of six in Group E and with a six-point lead and four games remaining, it gives Hodgson and England the chance to make amends for events in Brazil when they reach France, as they surely will, next summer.\nIt was also, however, a win that exposed cracks in England's make up as well as demonstrating some of the quality they can offer in attack.\nEngland's chaotic win, which contained some excellent passages of play, was the perfect antidote to those who believe they are entirely functional under Hodgson - but much of it was the wrong sort of excitement, especially in defence.\nSo how far have England come since the World Cup and that defeat by Italy in Manaus a year ago? And can they make a serious impact in France?\nOn results alone, England and Hodgson are above criticism - so it seems churlish to add any rider to a perfect qualifying campaign that is unblemished and a season that has seen them go unbeaten for the first time since 1990-91.\nThis has been, however, \"The Group of Death\" only when it comes to excitement. Once England skilfully negotiated what appeared to be the most hazardous fixture on their schedule, a 2-0 win in Switzerland in September courtesy of two goals from Danny Welbeck, the tone was set for routine qualification.\nHodgson will rightly argue England can only beat what has been put in front of them, which they have, but none of the qualifying games will provide any sort of accurate measure to how they would cope when confronted with an elite power in a competitive environment.\nAnd of course comfortable qualification for last summer's World Cup counted for little when England were effectively out after two games.\nThe bottom line is that heads would have rolled had England failed to qualify from this Euro 2016 group, with an inquiry to follow presumably, but it has been negotiated efficiently if not spectacularly.\nHodgson is entitled to ask what more England could have done - but it may be that friendlies arranged between now and the Euros will actually tell us more than the qualifying campaign.\nThere is no better plus point than an unblemished record of six from six - and there are other factors Hodgson can point to as he engenders hope and optimism ahead of Euro 2016.\nHodgson often talks of his squad being young and this is true. There is a younger, fresher look to England's squad, in part because of the retirement of the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard and the decision to move away from experienced players such as Glen Johnson. This feels like a new generation.\nJoe Hart remains one of the best goalkeepers in the world and Hodgson will look to develop young players in and around the team in the next 12 months - with an eye on talent emerging during the under-21 Euros later this month.\nDespite his contract impasse at Liverpool, 20-year-old Raheem Sterling will surely be a star of England's future and huge hopes remain for Everton's Ross Barkley, a wonderful talent who must rebuild after a disappointing 12 months.\nJack Wilshere has been a great hope for England over the last couple of seasons. He has seen his career curtailed by injuries but he rose to the occasion in Slovenia.\nHe was not simply the strong-running, creative Wilshere loved by Arsenal's supporters, he was a controlling influence in times of trouble and produced two spectacular strikes, his first for England on his 28th appearance.\nIf he can stay fit and build on that next season, Hodgson will finally have the midfield gem he has been waiting to polish.\nAnd in Gareth Southgate's Under-21 squad, there are players who will be earmarked to progress at such a rate to possibly make their mark in France, particularly Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Everton's elegant defender John Stones and West Brom forward Saido Berahino.\nHodgson will also hope striker Danny Ings's move to Liverpool will speed his development.\nAdd this to the quality and experience already provided by the likes of captain Wayne Rooney and with hopes Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge may actually stay fit (a long shot admittedly) and Hodgson will feel he can head into the Euros in good heart.\nWatch a video of England's defensive performance here in Ljubljana. They are easy to spot.\nEngland lacked defensive leadership, organisation, lacked a leader who, according to BBC Radio 5 live pundit Martin Keown, is in the mould of his former Arsenal captain Tony Adams, a defender who takes concession of a goal personally.\nA crass error from Phil Jones, a foul throw-in that went unpunished but straight to a Slovenia player, led to the first goal and weakness in the air brought the second.\nDefence is England's soft underbelly and better teams than Slovenia will have noticed its failings here.\nThe worry for Hodgson is that this is an old problem that remains uncured.\nBefore leaving for the World Cup, England's defence was pinpointed as an area of potential trouble, a flaw that could be unpicked by players of the highest class.\nAnd so it proved - not so much in defeat by Italy but in the decisive loss to Uruguay, where Luis Suarez, despite not being fully fit, tormented the central defensive duo of Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka to score twice.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThose questions remain about England's defensive quality, where Manchester United pairing Phil Jones and Chris Smalling have failed to convince and Jagielka, despite a superb personal season at Everton, is unlikely to be the answer in France.\nNeither convinced in Slovenia and Jones, in particular, looks all at sea at international level. Hodgson seems obsessed with finding him a place in the team - remember the failed holding midfield experiment against Italy in Turin? - but he has rarely looked accomplished for England.\nThis is where Stones may come in and partner Cahill, who is nowhere near as assured for England as he is at club level for Chelsea when he has John Terry alongside him for support.\nStones is untested at the highest level for all of his talent while the full-back spots are up for grabs, with Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne and Everton's Leighton Baines (who suffered badly at the World Cup) likely to emerge in pole position.\nEngland's midfield may see off the lower orders in the international pecking order but is its ball retention good enough against the best? It certainly was not at the World Cup and again this qualifying campaign has not offered a firm solution.\nAnd for all those who snipe, England are still heavily reliant on the goals, inspiration and leadership of captain Rooney - too reliant given the retirement of Gerrard and Lampard.\nRooney will be 30, and surely England's record goalscorer, by the time Euro 2016 starts. He has not had any significant impact on a major tournament since he burst on the scene as an Everton 18-year-old at Euro 2004 and yet it looks certain he will still be shouldering the heaviest burden of responsibility.\nFor all those who have questioned his place in the past, England have never, ever looked better without him.\nIt is perhaps a sign of England's lack of development that no-one has yet come forward to ease that strain on a player and personality so desperate to do well for England.\nNo - try asking a different question.\nCan England make an impact at Euro 2016? Yes\u2026 if all their best players fire.\nIt takes too much of a leap of the imagination to see England troubling the likes of Germany and Spain but they will give plenty of others a run for their money if Hodgson can somehow make all the pieces fit and prove he can inspire, and relate to, this younger group of players.\nIn flashes, admittedly against a Slovenia side ranked 48th in the world, they showed they have quality in attack. It is elsewhere that the failings are found.\nThere is talent within the squad that can get a result on a given day but when it comes to major tournaments England do not have enough given days.\nIt is not as big a task as the World Cup but surely England will survive the group but questions remain about how much further they would drive into the tournament.\nHard to assess. Results have been excellent but little excitement surrounds this England team under Hodgson, not helped by the standard of opposition in their Euro qualifying group and performances like the dross served up against the Republic of Ireland.\nThere has been that move towards the next era of younger players led by the likes of Wilshere, Sterling, Barkley but they still have so far to go.\nHodgson is satisfied with England's progress, saying: \"We started with a new group and we didn't know where that would lead but I've been quite pleased with what they've done so far.\"\nHe added: \"Grieving is too strong a word but there's a process. You have to give yourself time to get back in some sort of balance, But I'm satisfied we were able to get over it and to get off to a good start in the group in September and we've kept that going.\n\"It won't be forgotten. You don't forget bad moments in your life, no more than you do the good moments.  It's part of your life and part of your football life. Everyone in football has to develop the mental strength to deal with that and we've dealt with it.\"\nMeasured by results - the most important gauge of any team - England have progressed but the reality states that no-one will work out exactly how far, if at all, they have really come forward until they meet that first serious opposition at the Euros.","summary":"England are one year on from the debacle of their World Cup campaign in Brazil and one year out from Euro 2016 in France - the midpoint in a crucial process of recovery.","id":33129703}

{"document":"Robert Trigg was convicted of murdering 52-year-old Susan Nicholson in 2011 and of the manslaughter of Caroline Devlin, 35, who died in March 2006. Both were treated as not suspicious at the time\nTrigg, 52, was told he would serve a minimum of 25 years in prison.\nIn a statement in court, Ms Nicholson's elderly mother questioned why she had been able to gather enough evidence to bring the case to court but not police.\nDespite initial investigations into both deaths, in Worthing, West Sussex, finding nothing suspicious, Ms Nicholson's family refused to believe them.\nThey started what would be a five-year campaign to get to the truth.\nMs Nicholson's parents Elizabeth and Peter Skelton complained on three occasions to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) but were unsatisfied with its response.\nIn 2014 they hired a barrister and a forensic pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Carey, to re-examine the original pathologist's report.\nHe concluded that Ms Nicholson was suffocated by having her head forced into the bed.\nIn Ms Devlin's case, he found her death was was caused by a blow to the back of her head.\nIn a victim impact statement read out in court, Mrs Skelton said the family wanted answers over why she and her husband, now both in their 80s, were able to bring Trigg's case to court and not the police.\nShe said the fight for justice had caused \"mental torture\" which triggered a mild heart attack in her and caused depression in Ms Nicholson's brother.\nDuring the sentencing hearing, judge Mrs Justice Ingrid Simler said Mr and Mrs Skelton had \"fought doggedly and continuously since their daughter's death for the police to re-investigate her death\".\nShe added: \"The efforts of Ms Nicholson's family led to a review and re-investigation of her death and its cause.\"\nAddressing Trigg, the judge said: \"The grief and sadness of these two families will never leave them.\n\"These were senseless deaths and nothing can now restore their lives, nor can any part of this sentencing process restore them either.\"\nDuring the trial the court heard both women suffered domestic violence at the hands of Trigg during their relationships with him.\nHe was described as a \"possessive, controlling and jealous\" man and by one former girlfriend as a \"Jekyll and Hyde\" character who drank heavily.\nThe Skeltons said officers had never warned their daughter about Trigg's history of domestic violence.\nSussex Police has apologised to both families of Trigg's victims for not presenting all the facts to prosecutors following the original investigation.\nAsst Ch Con Laurence Taylor said: \"I am sorry it has taken so long to get the justice they wanted.\"\nThe IPCC said it upheld two complaints into the way Sussex Police dealt with complaints about its investigation into Ms Nicholson's death. A third appeal was not upheld, a spokeswoman said.\nSussex Police has now referred the case to the IPCC for \"an independent view and advice\", Mr Taylor said.\nBrandyn McKenna, the youngest son of Ms Devlin, said outside court on Wednesday: \"We have always said that it was all down to the Skelton family that we finally got justice.\"\nDuring his trial Trigg was described as \"no more than a drunken slob who could act in a loutish way\".\nThe court heard in both cases after the women died, a neighbour called 999 after Trigg failed to do so despite knowing they were dead.\nIn the case of Ms Devlin, Trigg had gone out for milk and made a coffee before telling one of her four children - then aged 14 - to go upstairs and check on his mother, knowing she was already dead.\nIn Ms Nicholson's case, he bought cigarettes before phoning his brother and then phoning a neighbour who lived upstairs.\nDuncan Atkinson QC, prosecuting, told the jury Trigg's presence, actions and inaction after the deaths of both women bound them together.","summary":"A man who killed two girlfriends five years apart has been jailed for life.","id":40519705}

Their boats capsized in bad weather on the way to the Greek island of Lesbos, the authorities say.\nTurkish media published harrowing images of the corpses, many still wearing life jackets that had apparently been of no use.\nMigrants are continuing to arrive on the Greek islands every day, despite the wintry weather. Lesbos is by far the most popular destination for migrants leaving Turkey.

{"document":"Supermarket Morrisons cut the price of diesel by up to 2p per litre, and Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's followed the move with their own price cuts.\nThe last time diesel was cheaper than petrol was 2001, according to analysis by Experian Catalyst.\nMorrisons said lower wholesale diesel costs meant it could pass on savings.\nMark Todd, petrol director for Morrisons, said: \"This is a milestone in motoring and many younger drivers won't remember the last time that diesel prices were lower than unleaded.\"\nPump prices are influenced by factors including the distance from oil terminals and refineries, so not all diesel prices will be lower than petrol, the supermarkets said.\nIn July 2001, diesel cost 77.92 pence per litre on average, compared with 77.94 pence for a litre of petrol, according to Experian Catalyst data. A month prior, diesel had been as much as a penny cheaper per litre, and a price difference of just under two pence was found in 2000.\nThere may be some delay until UK motorists see the price dip among all competitors. Experian Catalyst said the on Sunday UK average prices narrowed to 117.10 pence per litre for petrol and 118.33 pence for diesel.\nDiesel is normally more expensive than petrol per litre for a variety of reasons, according to the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association.\nWhile most recent investment in refineries UK has been for unleaded petrol production, more efficient engines mean petrol demand has been decreasing since the early 1990s, depressing prices by comparison to diesel, it says.\nHowever, increased supply of diesel from refineries outside the UK is likely to be the reason behind this recent price flip, according to the RAC.\n\"With the price of crude oil standing at $56.50 and the pound relatively strong against the US dollar - the fuel trading currency - there is scope for further price cuts of up to 4p per litre off diesel over the next fortnight, and unleaded may even benefit from a slight reduction too due to the continued oversupply of oil,\" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams.\n\"Drivers of unleaded petrol vehicles should not feel short changed - what we are seeing is the diesel pump price coming down to a level closer to what it should be due to the effects of greater refining capacity in the Middle East.\"\nWholesale prices for diesel have been cheaper than petrol since 27 May, the RAC said.\nAs crude oil has become cheaper, both petrol and diesel prices have fallen too. However, petrol prices have fallen more slowly allowing diesel to become cheaper, says James Challinor, research director for research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie. This is caused in part by demand for petrol from the US.\n\"Fundamentally it is strong demand for European gasoline [petrol] from the US and West Africa that is supporting the wholesale\" petrol price, he said.\nRefinery outages in Latin America are creating demand for exports of US petrol into that region, which in turn leads European petrol to be exported to the US, he added.","summary":"The price of diesel has fallen below petrol at some supermarkets for the first time in more than a decade, after the big chains announced price cuts.","id":33594585}

{"document":"More recently, women's football soared in popularity after the nation's female team won the World Cup in 2011 and Olympic Games silver in 2012.\nNow rugby union is looking for a similar breakthrough into the national consciousness, when its World Cup is hosted by Japan in 2019.\nWith the Olympic Games being held in Tokyo a year afterwards, the end of the decade is shaping up to be a major sporting time for Japan.\n\"These two events coming together means the Japanese citizens' interest in sport has already gone up, and should increase rapidly nearer the events,\" Koji Tokumasu, general manager of the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Organising Committee, tells BBC News.\nHe was recently in the UK for his nation's friendlies against Scotland and Gloucester, where Japan played with tenacity but lost both matches.\nJapan - known as the Cherry Blossoms or Brave Blossoms - are traditionally the strongest rugby union power in Asia.\nBut Mr Tokumasu says in Japan, where baseball is the most popular sport and football second, rugby union lags behind in about 10th spot.\n\"This is something we have to work on over the next six years,\" he says.\n\"We want to approach our existing fans - we do already have some rugby fans in Japan, and activate them to spread the World Cup message.\"\nHe says this hardcore fan-base can use digital media to publicise the rugby experience and the excitement surrounding the sport, including the thrill of match day.\nThey will also be able to explain the intricacies of the sport, including the scoring system.\n\"We want to raise interest and passion in the sport by bringing quality teams like New Zealand to our fans, who can then pass on the message to their family, friends and colleagues,\" says Mr Tokumasu.\nWhen Japan hosted world champions the All Blacks earlier in November, the 25,000 tickets were sold out after half an hour. The host nation, not surprisingly, lost that encounter, but there has been playing success this year.\nJapan won this year's HSBC Asian Five Nations tournament, and also beat a Wales second string team in the summer. That victory was their first win over a major rugby nation in eight decades of trying.\nTo show it was no fluke, they have also beaten the US and Canada this year.  In addition, this month Japan beat Russia, thrashed Spain, and also won the 2013 HSBC Asian Rugby Sevens.\nThe first stage of 2019 preparation is already under way, with the release of the criteria for would-be World Cup host cities and stadiums.\nOrganisers want to select between 10 and 12 match venues before March 2015, for the 48-game tournament.\n\"The reason we have chosen that date is because we want the successful host venues to then be able to attend that year's World Cup in England to see and experience how the event is staged,\" says Mr Tokumasu.\n\"At present we are visiting cities and telling them how exciting hosting the 2019 World Cup can be for them.\"\nIn Tokyo, a showpiece 80,000-capacity Olympic Stadium is being built in time for the 2019 rugby event, and in other match venue centres local government will pay for stadiums.\nIn many cities stadiums have remained underused since the 2002 World Cup.

{"document":"The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections.\nIt is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999.\nIt lost the presidential poll last month for the first time.\nAPC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan.\nThe PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja.\nThe party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo.\nIt also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency.\nHowever, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub.\nThe PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east.\nTaraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory.\nElections were not held in seven states.\nAnalysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja\nThe APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.\nHowever, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.\nIn parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.\nWhy Jonathan lost?\nBuhari's historic victory\nNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.\nMost of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.\nOn Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.\nIt means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.\nOur correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.\nThe party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.\nIt had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.\nThe PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.","summary":"The party of Nigeria's incoming president has won a landslide in elections for powerful state governors, ending the former ruling party's dominance.","id":32280676}

{"document":"It is in fact the Atacama desert in Chile, one of the driest places on Earth.\nAverage rainfall here is les than 0.1mm (0.004 in) per year and there are many regions which have not seen any precipitation for decades.\nBut while there is little rain, the clouds here do carry humidity.\nCoastal fog forms on Chile's shore and then moves inland in the form of cloud banks. The locals call it \"camanchaca\".\nThe fog is made up of minuscule drops of water which are so light they do not fall as rain.\nDuring a particularly severe drought in 1956, scientist Carlos Espinosa Arancibia had an idea.\nThe retired maths and physics professor from the University of Chile carried out a series of experiments in the highest hills near the city of Antofagasta.\nThere, he came up with the idea of the fog catcher: netting with tiny openings of approximately 1mm across to capture the tiny water droplets in the fog.\nThe droplets accumulate in the netting and form a bigger drop which eventually runs off the netting into a canal underneath.\nFrom there, it is channelled through a pipe to containers at the base of the hills, ready for use.\nAnd the research continues today.\nThe town of Pena Blanca boasts one of the biggest study centres for the fog catchers. There are six big nets in the hills overlooking the town.\nTechnical adviser Nicolas Schneider says that thanks to the fog catcher they have managed to combat the desertification of the region.\nHe says that 100 hectares now are again covered in the flora once typical for the region.\n\"We're planning to provide local families with water from the fog catcher in the near future,\" Mr Schneider says.\nAt the heart of the community is a small building which also uses water from the fog catcher: the town's small artisanal brewery.\nFog Catcher Brewery is small. It only produces has three vats and one cold store producing about 24,000 litres per year, but it is the pride and joy of its owner, Miguel Carcuro.\n\"The water from the camanchaca is of excellent quality and gives our beer a special quality,\" he says.\nThe project's backers say the fog catchers are cheap and sustainable.\nAn average-sized fog catcher of 40sq m costs between $1,000 (\u00a3635) and $1,500 depending on the material used.\nThey say its impact on the environment is minimal as the metal posts can be discreetly hidden among vegetation.\nAs the water is transported down the hill by gravity, there is no extra cost involved for transport, they say.\nIt is an idea which has been exported to other arid regions in Peru and Mexico.\nThe largest expanse of fog catchers is located in Tojquia in Guatemala, where 60 fog catchers trap 4,000 litres of water a day.\nProf Pilar Cereceda of the University of Chile says she hopes that within a decade Chile will have enough fog catchers to supply the whole Atacama region.\n\"I dream of the day in which the fog catchers can compete with desalination plants, which is not environmentally friendly.\"","summary":"The dry, red earth could almost be mistaken for a Martian landscape.","id":32515558}

The opening minutes saw them create a chance apiece, and that spell shaped the rest of the game.\nThe home side were first to impose themselves, but Greg Kiltie could not change his body shape quickly enough to properly connect with Josh Magennis's cross and he volleyed over as he rushed into the penalty area.\nKilmarnock would have been heartened by the opportunity, because their home form has been so consistently poor that the general mood at Rugby Park is a deep-seated anxiety. Even so, a familiar feeling of dismay swept round the ground soon after the Kiltie effort.\nIn County's first meaningful attack, Michael Gardyne delivered a cross into the penalty area from the left and Schalk slipped into space to glance a header into the far corner.\nHe was unmarked and had the time to compose himself, and that proved a costly aberration for Kilmarnock.\nThe goal invigorated Schalk. When another cross was sent into the area, he controlled the ball expertly with his back to goal, spun briskly and hit a shot on target that Jamie Macdonald had to move quickly to save.\nLater in the half, he was about to strike another effort from inside the area when Kilmarnock centre-back Conrad Balatoni slid in to block.\nThe home side were initially unsettled by their lack of resolve in defence, but they did not concede their place in the game and kept fighting their cause.\nIt was typical of their misfortune, though, that Topi Obadeyi had to be substituted in the 30th minute because  of injury.\nIt was Obadeyi who came closest to scoring in the first half, with a tame header wide from Rory McKenzie's cross.\nThe interval provided Kilmarnock boss Lee Clark with an opportunity to revive his side. There was certainly a greater attacking intent to the home side's play in the second half and McKenzie swept a shot on target early on, only to see the Ross County goalkeeper Gary Woods save.\nKilmarnock saw plenty of possession, while County seemed comfortable defending their lines and striking on the break.\nThey almost added to their lead when Graham's cross was headed against the outside of he post by Liam Boyce.\nIn the closing minutes, Kilmarnock's organisation abandoned them, and Graham was able to steer a header over the stranded Macdonald to seal the victory. Booing from the home fans greeted the final whistle.","summary":"A hard-fought victory sent Ross County climbing to fourth place in the Premiership and increased the sense of alarm at Rugby Park.","id":35637639}
{"document":"The planned deal was worth \u00a310.3bn, and would have left the UK with just three major mobile phone network operators.\nBut Europe's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said she had strong concerns about the takeover, ruling that it would reduce customer choice and raise prices.\nCK Hutchison said it was considering a legal challenge to the decision.\n\"The goal of EU merger control is to ensure that tie-ups do not weaken competition at the expense of consumers and businesses,\" said Ms Vestager.\n\"We want the mobile telecoms sector to be competitive, so that consumers can enjoy innovative mobile services at fair prices and high network quality.\"\nThe decision ruled that concessions offered by Hong-Kong based Hutchison - including a five year price freeze and billions of pounds in investments - \"were not sufficient to prevent\" the hampering of innovation and network infrastructure development.\nCK Hutchison responded to the decision, saying the acquisition of O2 from Spain's Telefonica would bring \"major benefits to the UK not only by unlocking \u00a310bn of private sector investment in the UK's digital infrastructure but also by addressing the country's coverage issues, enhancing network capacity, speeds and price competition for consumers\".\nO2 said the ruling had little impact on their UK operations. \"We work in an industry of constant change and have learnt how to manage that change better than most,\" said an O2 spokesperson.\n\"Regardless of what happens next, we will continue to deliver for our customers as we always have.\"\nIt was the deal that was supposed to be the final stage in the reshaping of Britain's mobile phone market. But now the O2\/Three marriage has been blocked by Brussels, where does that leave phone users?\nBetter off, according to regulators. The UK's communications regulator Ofcom, in particular, had argued that allowing the number of players in the market to fall from four to three would inevitably lead to higher prices, poorer service or both.\nThis sounds convincing in the short term. But, says much of the telecoms industry - if you look at the longer term health of Europe's mobile market - today's move is bad news for everyone.\nTo read Rory's analysis in full, click here\nThe commission points out that retail prices in the UK are currently amongst the lowest in Europe, with the four major network operators also including Vodafone and BT's Everything Everywhere, known as EE.\nThese four operators - who own infrastructure like telecoms masts - have cooperated to share the costs of developing that infrastructure. And it is the collapse of these cost-sharing deals that seriously worries the European commission.\nMeanwhile Liberty Global - the owner of Virgin Media - has said it would not rule out an acquisition of O2 if CK Hutchison's bid was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\"It would be strange if we didn't evaluate that option,\" chief executive Mike Fries told analysts on a recent results conference call.\nLiberty Global currently possesses a minimal share of the UK mobile market subsidiary Virgin, which acts as a so-called \"virtual operator.\" That means it must pay wholesale prices to access the network operated by BT's EE. Tesco and Asda operate their own virtual networks in a similar manner.\nLiberty Global recently ended negotiations for a major tie-up with Vodafone across Europe, settling simply for a Netherlands joint venture.\nKester Mann, a mobile operators analyst at CCS Insight, said global telecoms giants like Japan's Softbank or Mexico's America Movil could also be plausible buyers of O2, but that the \"most likely eventual outcome\" was a sale to a private equity firm.\n\"The collapse of the deal leaves both Three and O2 in a precarious position with uncertain futures in the UK,\" Mr Mann said.\nA spokesperson for the British telecoms regulator Ofcom said that it was the \"right outcome\" for mobile customers.\n\"Competition must be sustainable, and regulation should support it,\" said Ofcom. \"We will aim to do so through tools such as market reviews or auctions of mobile airwaves.\"\nThe European Commission has intervened in several proposed telecoms deals recently.\nA merger between the Danish operations of TeliaSonera and Telenor was abandoned last September after the commission investigated the deal.\nAnd there is also an ongoing probe of CK Hutchison's proposed merger with Italian operator Wind, owned by Russian firm Vimpelcom, that would create Italy's largest mobile phone network.","summary":"The European Commission has blocked Telefonica's sale of O2 to CK Hutchison, the owner of Three.","id":36266924}

But according to Mr Packham, turtle doves were vulnerable, with their numbers down by 95% in the UK.\nMalta is the only EU country to have a recreational spring hunting season allowing birds to be shot.\nMr Packham, a presenter of TV documentaries on wildlife, said Maltese hunters were ignoring restrictions under the exemption, or \"derogation\" in EU jargon.

{"document":"Special Report: The Technology of Business\nKenya's mobile money revolution\nAfrica mobile boom powers innovation\nIs tech saving the music industry?\nBusiness travel in hi-tech facelift\nCan tech combat modern slavery?\nBattery technology playing catch-up\nSuch digital technologies offer the potential to tackle some of the continent's chronic education challenges, including overcrowded classrooms, teacher shortages and the 30 million children in sub-Saharan Africa without any education at all.\nAs Africa becomes ever more connected, educators and publishers are finding new ways to reach young audiences and develop their burgeoning minds.\nOne such company is Via Afrika Publishers.\nFirst and foremost a publisher of textbooks for over 65 years, Via Afrika began to investigate the move to digital content several years ago. Its early adoption seems to be reaping dividends.\n\"We decided about three years ago, after looking at what was taking place in the world, that e-learning was an important direction to go in,\" says Michael Goodman, the company's group content manager.\n\"We decided to design a set of e-learning books that matched our printed books and indeed matched the books we submitted to the education department. It was a sort of 'build it and they will come' mentality, because there was no call for any electronic books to be submitted,\" he added.\nMr Goodman points out that uptake has really mushroomed over the past year. While there were about 1,000 e-book sales in 2013, there have already been 64,000 in 2014, he says.\nBut he admits that as the South African government has invested heavily in printed materials, a widespread shift towards e-learning will require partnerships between private enterprise and government.\n\"We are seeing pockets of co-operation,\" he says. \"Companies are coming up with their own initiatives in supplying tablets and then co-operating with government to implement them in schools.\n\"That needs to grow a whole lot. We feel that a very strong public and private partnership is needed to move us towards e-learning completely.\"\nVia Afrika has formed just such a partnership with a non-profit organisation, Breadline Africa, to provide rural communities with digital education centres.\nBreadline Africa is a Cape Town-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) that specialises in converting old shipping containers for community use.\nThe digital centres are being developed inside existing libraries and each is supplied with 15 Android tablet devices loaded with Via Afrika's latest educational programmes, apps and electronic textbooks.\nThe Via Afrika Digital Education Centre initiative is currently being rolled out in three primary schools in the provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Free State.\n\"I visited one school last week in Limpopo and to see how the kids have responded so positively in working with brand new media has been remarkable,\" says Mr Goodman.\n\"It's going to be interesting for us to see what the impact will be in a small rural school.\"\nOne of the challenges is educating the teachers as well as the children. So the centres will receive regular visits and updates to keep the educators aware of the latest developments, says Mr Goodman.\nLook around one of these centres and you will see people consuming content and interacting online in a variety of social networking spaces.\nOne such space is social learning platform Obami.com. The Cape Town-based firm is making waves with its brand of educational tools and online connections.\nFounded by Barbara Mallinson in 2007, Obami - which means \"my\" or \"mine\" in isiZulu - began as a generic social networking site.\nBut Ms Mallinson soon saw the opportunity to refine the concept and have an impact upon a key issue in South Africa - education.\n\"We are all very aware of the education crisis going on in South Africa and beyond. Social media was being used in entertainment and for business but no-one was really doing this in education,\" she explains.\nMs Mallinson and the Obami team wanted to see how social media in schools could be used to connect scholars, teachers and parents.\nThe first pilot study \"went wonderfully\", she says, although the teachers remained wary of social networking for social networking's sake.\n\"We looked at it again and thought social networking is very useful in many industries but it has to serve a purpose, and so we decided to change a few things and ended up with this idea of social media being applied to a learning management system.\"\nThis means uploading and sharing content, and setting and undertaking assignments, she explains. Sharing curriculum content online and monitoring learners through assessment were core principles \"bringing the platform to life\".\nOver the past few years, Obami has continued to grow across South Africa and the continent with about 400 schools and organisations now using the platform to connect learners and partners.\nAs the platform is customisable it is equally suitable for an early stage learner as for an adult involved in distance learning, the company believes. It is accessible via PC, tablet or phone.\n\"Obami was traditionally a primary and secondary platform but we have now opened it up beyond schools,\" she says.\n\"We also found a demand from scholars whose schools weren't using the platform to get on to Obami, so we started our own school of sorts and now have nearly 4,000 individuals on the platform who can access its learning capabilities and content.\"\nFew believe technology for its own sake will be the knight in shining armour that helps South Africa and the continent educate its youth more effectively.\nBut used strategically by educators, publishers and government working in partnership, it has the potential to achieve great things. And fast.","summary":"In Africa's schools, old-fashioned, dusty textbooks are gradually being replaced by tablets, computers and mobile phones.","id":28191371}

{"document":"The study, published on the British Medical Journal website, showed that the failure rate could be cut in half.\nResearchers analysed data from patients who were taking bisphosphonates, which are used to prevent the loss of bone material.\nHowever, scientists say further studies are still needed.\nWhen joints become damaged or worn out, commonly due to osteoarthritis, it can be painful and limits movement.\nAn implant can dramatically improve a patient's mobility. More than 50,000 hip and 70,000 knee, replacements take place in the UK each year.\nWhile they can last for decades, some fail within years. This can happen when the bone around the implant is dissolved by the body meaning the replacement joint becomes loose.\nThe theory was that bisphosphonates, which are used by patients with osteoporosis to prevent bone being broken down, would prevent the loosening.\nThe researchers looked at data from General Practice Research Database for joint replacements and compared what happened to 1,912 patients taking bisphosphonates with 41,995 patients who did not.\nAfter five years, 1.96% of implants failed without the drug, compared with 0.93% in those taking medication.\nProf Nigel Arden, a specialist in rheumatic diseases at the Universities of Oxford and Southampton, said the first implant would cost the NHS about \u00c2\u00a37,000, but replacements would cost \u00c2\u00a334,000.\nHe told the BBC: \"It has the potential to have a huge impact.\"\nHe said two of the risk factors, age and obesity, meant the number of cases was \"increasing dramatically\".\nProf Arden is not arguing that people should be given the drug yet.

The fear from civilians is that this could make all cars vulnerable to an air strike or put them at risk of being attacked in the battle for the city.\nSo far, air strikes have been carefully targeted at government buildings and military sites, according to this view from the city.

{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nThen you look at the statistics, and a more complicated picture emerges: a 30-point winning margin but less possession than Italy, less territory, more tackles missed and fewer line breaks made.\nNit-picking or nagging doubts? That is the problem with thrilling wins like the one in Cardiff: they inflate expectations, convince the giddy that a team is not just ascendant but untroubled.\nEngland started slowly, again, and were once again behind with a quarter of the contest gone. They then took control for half an hour, played with pace and imagination and considerable verve, and were out of sight by the time Italy staged their late and immaterial fight-back.\nThat will be enough for some. In the corresponding fixture two years ago Stuart Lancaster's men were held try-less. In Jonathan Joseph they had not only Saturday's outstanding performer but a young dancer and dasher who is terrifying defenders and delighting supporters every time he is given the ball.\nLancaster, for one, wants more. Miss 22 tackles in Dublin on Sunday week and he knows dreams of a Grand Slam will remain exactly that. Give away breakdown penalties to a side with a player who can kick off the tee - Ireland's Johnny Sexton will not be as profligate as Italy 10 Kelly Haimona - and it will be a far steeper road back.\nFor George Ford, man of the match in the Millennium, this was a different sort of challenge in a different sort of match.\nSo far in his nascent Test career the 21-year-old fly-half has had to deal with a disorganised Samoa, an Australian pack going backwards at pace and a giant Welsh back-line determined to dent both his confidence and body.\nA week ago there was plenty of kicking from hand, a resolve under intense pressure, a premium on his penalty points.\nOn Saturday he could have missed every effort from the Twickenham turf and still seen his side win with something to spare. Instead it was all about the attack - controlling the tempo, choosing his options, freeing the talent outside him.\nHe began well, clearing from his own line off his weaker foot after Ben Youngs' poor pass had cut his time and space. A minute later he was putting a probing kick deep into Italian territory, dabbing another into the 22 only to see it gathered to begin the move that led, 70 metres and two minutes later, to Sergio Parisse's opening try for Italy.\nFord, as the win over Wales showed, is not cowed by early disappointment. It was his precision long-range penalty tight to the corner flag that set up England's opening try through Billy Vunipola's line-out drive, his ability to play flat to the gain-line that was creating options for the runners and ball-carriers cantering in support.\nNot always did he make the right choice. Half an hour in he wasted turnover ball with a poor kick straight down the gullet of his opposite number Haimona. At other times he became a fraction static, passing the ball standing still rather than running at the defensive line to commit and confuse defenders.\nBut in his vision and hands he has what England fans crave from their number 10: creativity, a little conjuring, the quickness of mind and foot to make it count against a well-drilled defence.\nSo it was in the move that led to Joseph's second try. He hung behind his pack, hinting that he might drift down the blind-side, then scything back round to the open spaces on the right after Billy Twelvetrees had come in at first receiver.\nTwelvetrees timed his pass behind Luther Burrell, and then Ford worked his magic - spotting Anthony Watson drawing one defender wide, faking a quick pass outside to Joseph and then delaying it a fraction as the covering man committed, before popping up a pass for his Bath team-mate to come onto at full pace.\nAfter the conversion he was gone, replaced for the final hurrah by another creative mind in Danny Cipriani. But the learning-curve continues, his precocious talents an increasingly pivotal part of Lancaster's plans.\nHis personal stats were solid rather than spectacular: 15 points, just one kick missed from tee from seven, 47 metres made with ball in hand, 31 accurate passes. His kicking style requires a little further fine-tuning, even if he has improved markedly in the last year.\nThere is so much there, and at such a young age, that few doubt that the progression will continue.\nThere is the character, preternatural yet visible from the moment he began playing in England's age-group teams ahead of his time. There are the little details, like the way he manages to almost imperceptibly shift his weight in contact to ride out or roll big tackles. And there is ambition: this is not enough, I must do more.\nThere is also a connection with the key men outside him. Joseph made more metres (123) than any other player, beat five men in seven carries, made two clean breaks. It was Ford's pass that set him away both times.\nTogether with the solidity of England's set-piece, the impact of their replacements and the form in other key positions of Chris Robshaw and Ben Youngs, it means England are aware of two things: they must aspire to better still, but they have the tools to get there.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device","summary":"After the unexpected delight for England supporters of last week's stirring comeback victory over Wales, Saturday's 47-17 win over Italy appears a predictable pleasure: six tries, some scintillating running, a 21st victory in 21 contests between the two.","id":31475112}

It was then opened up to anyone and was launched in the UK last summer.\nIt had been expected that it would be followed reasonably quickly by a full consumer launch.\nFrom next week, the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using Glass.\nThe Glass team will also move out of the Google X division which engages in \"blue sky\" research, and become a separate undertaking, under its current manager Ivy Ross.\nShe and the Glass team will report to Tony Fadell, the chief executive of the home automation business Nest, acquired by Google a year ago.\nHe said the project had \"broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike\" and he was excited to be working with the team \"to integrate those learnings into future products\".\nGoogle says it is committed to working on the future of the product, but gave no timescale for the launch of any new version.\nThe Glass project received the enthusiastic backing of Google's co-founder Sergey Brin. He presided over a spectacular unveiling which saw skydivers jump out of an aircraft wearing Glass and beam what they were seeing to a conference in San Francisco.\nEarly users of Glass were very excited about the product, which enabled them get information in a small screen above their right eye, take photos and videos, and get directions. The technology blogger Robert Scoble said he could not now imagine living a day without the product, and was even photographed wearing it in the shower.\nBut he and others soon tired of Glass, complaining that it was not evolving in the ways that had been promised. There were also concerns about privacy and safety, with some bars and restaurants banning the use of the smart glasses on their premises.\nOther companies have launched smart glasses and various other forms of wearable technology. But no single product has yet proved the major hit that technology companies are looking for as they seek out the next big thing.\nGoogle has tried to present this announcement as just another step in the evolution of an amazing innovation. But make no mistake - Google Glass is dead, at least in its present form.\nAs I found when I spent a couple of months wearing Glass, it has a number of really useful aspects - in particular the camera. There is however one huge disadvantage - it makes its users look daft, and that meant that it was never going to appeal to a wide audience.\nBut Google will now have to deal with a disgruntled community of Explorers who paid a large sum for a device which they must have believed would eventually evolve into something more useful.\nThe Glass team can at least continue its work out of the spotlight without the pressure of deadlines. Tony Fadell, the former Apple designer Google acquired with his smart thermostat firm Nest, will oversee the future of the product.\nBoth he and the Glass team leader Ivy Ross, who has come from the fashion world, will know that form as well as function will have to be at the centre of any successful piece of wearable technology.","summary":"Google is ending sales of its Google Glass eyewear.","id":30831128}

At one doorstep the householder told the DUP candidate not to worry,  his animal didn't bite, before adding rather worryingly \"unless I tell him to\".\nThe pet owner then tackled Gavin Robinson about the pact agreed between the DUP and the Ulster Unionists in East Belfast, telling him \"I didn't like you joining up with two parties together against Naomi\".\nThe candidate responded that the deal had been decided \"over my head\".\nOn another doorstep not far away another candidate, Alliance's Naomi Long came across another over excited dog, named Chuckie. \"Don't worry\" the lady who answered the door assured her, \"Chuckie's an Alliance supporter\".\nNaomi Long's victory over the DUP leader Peter Robinson, who held East Belfast for 30 years, was the big surprise of the 2010 election.\nAlliance benefited from an anti-Robinson mood after TV investigations into his family's business dealings and a decision by some loyalists to lend their votes to Ms Long.\nBut since then the Alliance MP has found herself on the receiving end of death threats as a result of the Belfast council Union Flag dispute.\nShe told me the intimidation remains a regular occurrence - indeed she was hit by a projectile just this week after visiting a nail salon which had been targeted by racist arsonists.\nWhilst condemning that kind of behaviour, unionists argue that Alliance bears responsibility for its own decisions in limiting the flying of the Union flag over Belfast City Hall.\nNow Gavin Robinson, a namesake but not a relation of the DUP leader, has high hopes of winning East Belfast back for unionism.\nThe man with the barking dog might not like the pact, but others I talked to on the streets of East Belfast think unionists should have been co-operating long ago.\nGavin Robinson insists the pact has been broadly welcomed.

I don't ever take a day off.\"\nWhen Kayden fell on to a bed at home last April, banging his mouth on his bottle, Julie thought little of it, but his lips turned blue, so eventually she called an ambulance.\nStaff at nearby Stepping Hill Hospital took a chest X-ray, and told Julie and Shannon that Kayden had a hole in his diaphragm, a hernia that he had probably had since birth.\nThey told her not to worry, but that he needed a simple operation to mend the hole.\nThey were, after an overnight delay, sent to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, where they were admitted to a ward and, in Julie's words, \"basically put in a room, and left\".\nDays passed, and with each one Kayden's operation was postponed.\nBecause his bowels and stomach had entered his chest through the hole in his diaphragm, he was in pain.\nThe family stayed by his bedside day and night, pushing the hospital staff to find an operation slot for him.\n\"I was just so angry with them because nobody would listen. Nobody would listen to how much pain he was in, and he was in a lot of pain,\" says Julie.\nFinally, on Friday night, five days after Kayden first fell ill, Shannon rang Julie. \"She told me he was grunting in his sleep,\" says Julie. \"I told her to get a nurse.\"\nKayden was going into cardiac arrest - his eyes became fixed on the ceiling, and staff rushed to save him.\nThe internal call system for summoning help failed though, and there were delays.\nIt took almost 30 minutes to resuscitate him.\nFinally, the hospital sprang into action, and Kayden was taken into surgery.\nIt took four hours of surgery to fix his hernia, and the family was taken to see him in intensive care.\nTragically, he had been starved of oxygen for too long, and his brain was irreparably injured.\nAfter a weekend of saying their goodbyes, Shannon had to agree to turn off his life support. He died minutes later in her arms.\n\"I wanted to strangle somebody,\" says Julie. \"You don't expect to take a baby to hospital and come away without one.

Many of the works would be welcomed with open arms by the curators of any of the world's top galleries.\nHe, through his lawyers, had agreed that any works shown to have been looted by the Nazis would be returned to their rightful present-day owners, but this might well be only a small fraction of the total, perhaps 50 works altogether out of some 1,400.\nThe rest will now be the subject of a morass of litigation. Mr Gurlitt never married and he had no known family. One question may be if there are distant relatives, who would now stake a claim. Many people, particularly Jewish groups, may feel a just solution would be for the works to be displayed in a gallery. Lawyers might have something to say about that. What is just, and what is legally applicable, may be two different things.\nHis collection only came to light after a routine check found he was carrying wads of cash on a train from Switzerland, triggering a tax inquiry.\nInvestigators found more than 1,400 works in his flat in Munich in February 2012 - though they only revealed the discovery in late 2013 - and a further 60 in his house near Salzburg, Austria, earlier this year.\nAmong them were works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Marc Chagall, Emil Nolde and Max Liebermann.\nThe collection is estimated to be worth up to a billion euros (\u00c2\u00a3850m; $1.35bn).\nUnder German law, Cornelius Gurlitt was not compelled to return any paintings to their owners, as he was protected by a statute of limitations, which negates any claim for incidents that happened more than 30 years ago.\nEven if it was proved the works were looted by the Nazis, Mr Gurlitt could have kept them, the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz says.\nBut his death will certainly have ramifications for the case.\nMr Gurlitt's secretive nature means little is known of his private life or any possible heirs.\nAnd the Bavarian authorities' slow, bureaucratic response to the discovery thus far would suggest that a rapid resolution of outstanding claims is unlikely, our editor adds.","summary":"German art hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt has died aged 81, with no definitive answer on what will happen to his secret collection, which included many Nazi-looted pieces.","id":27298832}

It was a kind of surge which reached the first floor of our hotel.\nZoe Cryer, Louis' mother, Sri Lanka\nSurvival instincts totally kick in. I thought our balcony might collapse. My main worry was for my 13-year-old who wasn't such a strong swimmer.\nWe grabbed what we could and got out as quickly as possible. My youngest son, Felix, had been studying tsunamis in geography. He was the first one to realise what had happened. He saw the islands disappearing.\nWhen we returned, all the buildings in front of the guest house had been pulled away. A crowd gathered around a woman who had collapsed. I'm qualified in first aid so went to help. We tried to give mouth to mouth, but she died. I'd never seen a dead body before.\nMany tourists had the opportunity to fly out immediately but I felt strongly that we needed to make our peace with what had happened - with the country and with the people. We were supposed to travel to southern India but went home instead. I didn't think it was right to be there. It was a while before I could look at the sea and feel comfortable.\nIt flattened walls, trees, and the buildings around us, before rising higher and higher. We tried to get people out. Miraculously, guests who had been in the room underneath us started popping up from the water.\nOne woman was trapped in her locked room because she couldn't find her key. She said the room filled up quickly with water and she took what she thought would be her last breath. Luckily she found the key and opened the door which then burst into pieces under the pressure.\nBuildings were collapsing around us. We tried to pull out passing people trapped in the currents.\nWhen the water finally subsided we made a run for higher ground and a temple that had become a make-shift safe refugee area. We set up camp in a hotel up on a hill and when it was safe to do so, we went back down to salvage anything we could. I remember seeing rooms full of mud and fish.\nPeople came up to the temple with dead bodies. We carried one Italian woman with a suspected broken back through the debris to another hotel to get medical help. I met one guy who had been out surfing and was swept a few miles up the coast. He had to walk through all the death and destruction to find his family. Luckily he found them all.\nOne of the only positives to come out of it all was the humanity of it. It didn't matter about your nationality or religion. Everyone was checking on each other.\nA few days later, once the road was clear, the High Commission sent coaches to take us back to a refugee centre in Colombo. We were fed, watered, offered clothes and flights home but we chose not go straight away. We wanted to stay to try and comprehend the reality of what had happened.\nThe main thing we felt was guilt. After seeing the devastation, we were lucky enough leave, but many were left with nothing.\nOnce in the UK, I put on an exhibition of photos I'd taken, spoke about it at our school and raised \u00c2\u00a33500 to send back to the village.\nI gained a new-found respect for the sea. I never realised its power. It hasn't put me off going in the water, but I'm a lot more aware of what it can do.\nWe were having breakfast at the hotel on a terrace, overlooking the pool, the beach and the Andaman Sea. My husband Tom noticed the waiters were all pointing at the sea which was receding rapidly. It was a fascinating sight. People got their cameras out and walked towards the dry seabed. The beach was full of sunbathing tourists.\nTom had an uncomfortable feeling though. He lived for two years on the beach in California and had never seen a sea behave like this. Then it clicked: the trembling he heard earlier was an earthquake. The receding water was the prelude to a tidal wave.\nTom grabbed my hand and screamed, \"Run!\". At that same moment, he saw a high wall of water come crashing over the reef towards us at a speed of 40-50mph. We ran uphill fast. The water was right behind us. The noise was deafening.\nTom looked behind and saw the beach and pool area were a boiling mass of water. Palm trees, beach chairs and parts of bungalows were twirling around and people were frantically trying to hold on to something. We kept going for higher ground, up the steep hill into the jungle beyond it. We waited for two hours, knowing only few people would have survived the onslaught below.\nWhen the sea looked calm again we descended to the hotel, and found many badly wounded people. We helped to get them onto the back of trucks taking people to hospital.\nThen we were warned another tsunami was on its way so we climbed up into the jungle again, where we waited three more hours.\nWe then came down to the road there were cars and trucks loaded with the wounded. No one knew what to do or where to go. We did not want to go down to the lower level and see all the corpses that littered the beach.\nThere was no electricity, no cell-phone network nor radio, so we spent the night at a small restaurant stand.\nThe next day the road was clear, and we could start the long trip home. The floor of the bus station was covered with wounded people, all waiting for the bus to Bangkok. People nearly cried at the opportunity to use our cell phone and reach their families to tell them they were alive.\nThe guilt was hard to bear. I will never forgive myself for not going to the hospital with the wounded but mainly for coming back unscratched.\nTen years on and we are still looking at life with a lot of more appreciation. We feel connected with Thailand so that is why we continue with a Thai animal charity.\nMy partner and I had won a snorkling trip at a raffle on Christmas Eve at our hotel, Phi Phi Charlie on Koh Phi Phi. That raffle saved our lives.\nWe had been snorkelling in the water when the Thai guides started to call everyone back onto the boats. The water had receded rapidly from the shoreline and nobody knew what was happening. We were lucky that we managed to get back onto the boat as the waves came in, and the boat swiftly repositioned itself some few hundred metres away from the coast. However, as strange currents began to develop and the waves started to impact upon the bay, we saw people being swept away.\nLongtail boats that had been closer to the shoreline snapped and sank like twigs. We can't believe how lucky we were to get back onto the boat as we don't know what happened to the people we had been snorkelling with and who had been swept away.\nWe just thought some localised freak incident had taken place but 30 minutes later the boat guides had a phone call from friends who told them Phuket and Phi Phi Don had been hit badly by a tsunami.\nIt became clear that Koh Phi Phi, where we had been staying, was devastated by the waves. Our hotel was destroyed, and it was only recently we found out that over half the people staying there were killed. We stayed in open water for the rest of the day waiting for more advice about what to do.\nIt wasn't until late afternoon that the boat took us back to Koh Phi Phi Don. It was then that the tragedy became apparent.\nWe were sailing in a soup of debris from the island which included TVs, fridges, holiday books and worse. It was just awful. We could see that the island was devastated and the infrastructure was shattered.\nOne man on board had a mobile phone. We all took it in turns to try to call home. Eventually I got through to my brother-in-law. I have never heard anyone speak with such worry and relief. He told me that everyone was so worried and had feared the worst.\nWe all decided to stay on the boat that night, moored out at sea. The boat was too small to have taken us all the way to Phuket. The only option we had was to wait for help to arrive in the morning. It was the longest night of my life and were it not for the camaraderie of those passengers on board and the wonderful generosity of the Thai people who owned and manned the boat, it would have been unbearable.\nAs the sun rose, we took the boat in to the harbour once again and waited for the larger boats to arrive. It was just awful. From our position on the water we saw hundreds of people all desperate to get off the island. They were huddled together on the pier in the harbour.\nWe eventually got the ferry boat to Phuket that morning and after a long wait we boarded an army plane back to Bangkok and a flight home.\nWe had lost all of our possessions but didn't care, we were so grateful to be alive. It was such an awful situation and such a random tragedy. Why did we take that boat trip that day? What if we had overslept? Why should we be the ones to survive and not so many others like us who didn't. It is senseless and random and just so utterly sad.\nEvery 26 December since the tsunami my partner and I take a walk on a beach and reflect on that devastating day. We will remember those who died again this year.\nProduced by Sherie Ryder and Helen Dafedjaiye","summary":"On 26 December 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, triggered a deadly tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people and rendered millions homeless.","id":30462238}

{"document":"He made the pledge to the UN General Assembly in New York in 2012, saying Myanmar (also known as Burma)  was on a path from which it would not backtrack. His visit to the United States was the first by a Burmese leader in 46 years.\nThein Sein, 67, took office in March 2011, after the country's first election in 20 years in November 2010. Since then, he has led a process of reform in Myanmar, ruled for decades by a military junta of which he was a key member.\nUnder his administration the government has freed hundreds of prisoners, including political detainees, embarked on peace deals with ethnic minority groups and relaxed media censorship.\nHe has been welcomed cautiously onto the world stage, despite warnings from critics that many key tests remain for Myanmar's reform process.\nThis warning was echoed in November 2014 by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who said that the pace of reform had stalled.\nBorn in a small village in the delta of the Irrawaddy river, in an area now known as Ngapudaw township, Thein Sein was from a humble background.  His parents were farmers, he said.\nHe graduated with an arts degree from Burma's military academy in 1968 and rose steadily through the ranks in his 40-year career.\nHe reached the leadership circle in the 1990s when he became a member of the State Peace and Development Council, as the junta called itself at the time.\nHe was made first secretary of the council after the downfall of former intelligence chief General Khin Nyunt in 2004. Thein Sein also chaired the National Convention, which drafted the country's new constitution.\nWhen the previous prime minister, Soe Win, fell ill, Thein Sein was made acting prime minister in May 2007.\nConfirmed in the post in October that year, he became the public face of the regime, representing it at Asean and UN meetings. He served as prime minister for four years.\nIn April 2010, like many other top junta officials, he swapped military uniform for civilian garb to form a political party.\nIt was Thein Sein who applied to register the United Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which dominated the elections in November 2010 and has sweeping control of the parliament.\nAnalysts said at the time that his appointment was orchestrated by junta leader Than Shwe, who needed an acceptable face to front the country's transition.\n\"He won't rock the boat,\" said Aung Zaw, editor of the Thailand-based Irrawaddy magazine, speaking when he took office.\n\"He is not a fire-breathing dragon, so he doesn't pose any threat to Than Shwe, who will continue to exercise absolute power.\"\nBut once he took office, Thein Sein's government began a process of change that surprised his critics.\nHe met freed pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who subsequently chose to bring her NLD party back into the political process, having boycotted the November polls.\nThe NLD contested by-elections which were deemed by observers to be largely free and fair.\nOver the years since her release Thein Sein appears to have developed a good working relationship with Ms Suu Kyi.   Media reports made much of the fact that he met her, congratulated her on receiving the US Congressional Medal of Honor and referred to her as a Nobel laureate publicly.\nKnown to be quiet by nature, Thein Sein has engaged more with international media.  He began a steady push for the West to lift sanctions, something he said was a necessity for democracy to thrive and the lives of Myanmar's people to improve.\n\"There is a quiet determination to him, he is quiet and soft-spoken but will not flinch from a question posed to him,\" Vijay Nambiar, the UN's top adviser on Myanmar, told Bloomberg.\nAsked in a BBC interview whether he was afraid he would be swept away by the winds of change like Mikhail Gorbachev after the fall of the Soviet Union, Thein Sein answered: \"I would like to say that Gorbachev and I are not alike, I tell you that.\n''We are not making reforms because I want to. We are merely responding to the people's desire for reform. Therefore my future depends on the people and their wishes.\"\nBut he was clear that the military would always have a key role in politics. He also made no apology for its past actions, such as imprisoning dissidents and activists.\n\"They were acting on their beliefs and we were acting on our beliefs,\" he said. \"Everyone was working for the country in their own way.\"","summary":"Myanmar's President Thein Sein, a former general, may go down in history as the man who led \"irreversible change\".","id":12358204}

{"document":"For \u00a339m, the firm is buying what is estimated to be up to a quarter of the timber released by NRW every year.\nAuditor General Huw Vaughan Thomas said he was unable to satisfy himself on whether the decision to make the deal was lawful.\nNRW disputed the findings.\nThe allegations have been made in a response to the 2015\/16 accounts of NRW by Mr Thomas, who called the deal \"irregular\".\nHe said the decision-making process was not transparent and expressed \"doubt\" over whether it met EU state aid rules.\n\"I have not been able to satisfy myself that the decision to agree those contracts was lawful and did not involve the provision of state aid,\" he wrote.\nThe identity of the company has not been revealed because NRW said the matter was commercially sensitive.\nAs a condition of the contract, the company said it would construct and operate a new saw line at its Welsh premises by 31 March 2016 but NRW said that condition was not met and was extended by 12 months.\nNRW would not say whether the condition had been met since last March.\nA report by the auditor general said that in 2014, NRW entered into an agreement with a sawmill operator for eight connected timber sales contracts, in a bid to try to halt the spread of a disease.\nThe firm purchased both spruce and larch timber, the latter of which was from forests where a fungus disease - P Ramorum - that causes extensive damage was present.\nBut the report said no other potential purchasers were given the opportunity to bid for the timber.\nThe value of the contract was designed to enable the operator to make a major investment in the sawmill - the operator said four of the contracts for larch would not have been enough to invest in the new saw line.\nNRW told auditors it had to act, that there was no alternative and that it was highly unlikely that any other operators would have been interested.\nBut Mr Thomas believed the 10-year-long deal would have been an opportunity other operators may have been interested in.\nThis, the lack of market testing and the fact NRW admitted in internal documents that the award of the contract gave rise to the risk of challenge by another company, led the auditor to believe it should have been referred to Welsh Government because it was contentious and could have repercussions on the wider market.\nBut it was not referred to the Welsh Government in that way, and as a result the contracts were \"irregular\" in the auditor's view.\nMr Thomas also said that the awarding of contracts to the sawmill operator was neither \"robust nor transparent\", saying NRW was unable to provide \"sufficient contemporaneous documentation\" that demonstrated what it took into account when it decided to enter the contracts.\n\"In the absence of sufficient evidence, I have been unable to satisfy myself that NRW's decision to enter into these contracts with the sawmill operator was taken in accordance with public law principles,\" he wrote.\nThe auditor said his uncertainty did not mean the contracts should now be regarded as unlawful or represent poor value for money.\nHe added that NRW \"failed to follow appropriate processes for ensuring that the outputs for which it contracted with the sawmill operator were obtained on market terms\".\n\"This failure gives rise to doubt as to the compliance of the contracts with... state aid rules.\"\nNRW has disputed his conclusions on both the issue of law and state aid.\nIt said it strongly believed the contracts were lawful and said it had legal advice that supported that view.\nIt said the spread of the P Ranorum disease, which happened within the first year of NRW's existence, gave rise to exceptional circumstances.\nKevin Ingram of NRW said: \"We are disappointed with the WAO's findings regarding aspects of some long-term sales contracts.\n\"Nevertheless, we have an action plan to learn the lessons from this to ensure even stronger governance arrangements in future.\"\nBut he said the audit and other reports showed \"NRW is a well-governed and managed organisation\".\n\"We are pleased it has found our financial reporting is fair and accurate,\" he said.\nChairman of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, Conservative AM Nick Ramsay, said he was \"very concerned\" by the report.\n\"It's now important that Public Accounts Committee questions officials from the body at the earliest opportunity,\" he said.\nThe matter was discussed at the assembly's finance committee on Wednesday -

{"document":"They trailed by seven at the break as Rob Kearney, Josh van der Flier and Zane Kirchner crossed to cancel out scores from Seymour and Tim Swinson.\nScotland winger Seymour then lacerated Leinster with three predatory strikes after the break.\nThe bonus-point win sees Warriors level on points with Pro12 leaders Ospreys.\nThis was a compelling shoot-out between two Pro12 heavyweights who have fought some thunderous bouts in the recent past.\nThe defending was often porous - Glasgow's missed tackle count hitting double figures, while Leinster were manipulated by the speed and variety of the Warriors attack.\nWhen the opening try came, it was textbook Glasgow. After punishing carries from Jonny Gray and then Leonardo Sarto took the Warriors into the Leinster 22, the ball was swept to the opposite wing, with Sam Johnson zipping a sumptuous pass for Seymour to scamper in at the corner.\nCo-captain Henry Pyrgos missed the conversion, and the rest of the half belonged chiefly to the Irish province.\nTheir pack were heaved into touch as they rumbled towards the freshly painted whitewash but it was a temporary reprieve for Glasgow, reliant on last-ditch breakdown scrapping with the visitors repeatedly puncturing their midfield.\nEventually they crumbled, the Ireland full-back, Rob Kearney, scything through two missed tackles and finishing well at the corner, young pivot Joey Carbery converting magnificently from the touchline.\nThe response from Glasgow was immediate and resounding. Swinson capped a spell of rapid, aggressive phase play, neatly orchestrated by Pete Horne at fly-half, by driving over between the posts, Pyrgos converting, barely two minutes after Kearney's try.\nBack surged Leinster and Sarto was dispatched to the sin-bin for infringing metres from his own line.\nIt culminated in a comically simple try for Van der Flier as the flanker scooped up the ball from the ruck and exploited the lack of any discernible fringe defence, shrugging off Simone Favaro's lunge and sprinting under the posts, Carbery again adding the conversion.\nThen, with the clock red, Leinster pounced again, Kirchner gathering Carbery's delicate crosskick on the bounce and racing in for an unconverted score and a seven-point half-time lead.\nThat advantage was bolstered by Carbery's penalty four minutes into the second period as Glasgow struggled to exit cleanly from their own half.\nHowever, if the first 40 minutes belonged to Leinster, the second was sole property of Seymour as the Pro12's hottest finisher produced an irrepressible combination of speed, power and opportunism to turn the game on its head.\nFirst, he plucked Carbery's pass from the air to dot down under the posts for Pyrgos to convert.\nThen, a minute later, he seized on another loose Leinster pass to spin out of a tackle and out-pace the chasing defence to the line.\nWith Pyrgos' conversion, suddenly the Warriors led.\nCarbery cut the deficit to a point with a penalty just after the hour, but it was Seymour who had the emphatic final word.\nFrom a scrummage deep in the Leinster 22, he fizzed brilliantly on to Pyrgos' inside flick, the winger's momentum carrying him towards a remarkable fourth try - his sixth in two matches - and an easy conversion for his co-captain.\nA dynamic and fitting climax as Glasgow followed last week's rout of defending champions Connacht with this high-octane defeat of the early title favourites.\nGlasgow Warriors: Hogg, Sarto, Dunbar, Johnson, Seymour, Horne, Pyrgos, Reid, Brown, Puafisi, Swinson, Gray, Harley, Favaro, Wilson.\nReplacements: Flynn (for Brown, 68), Allan (for Reid, 68), Fagerson (for Puafisi, 49), Uanivi (for Swinson, 77), Wynne (for Favaro, 68), Jones (for Sarto, 68).\nNot Used: Price, Clegg.\nYellow card: Sarto (36).\nLeinster: R.

He describes it as more of an \"ongoing process\".\n\"It's like a jigsaw puzzle in which the picture gradually becomes clear. The BBC orchestras are the corners, the edge pieces - the outline of the festival programme.\"\nWith many international orchestras planning tours four or five years in advance, some pieces of the puzzle can fit into place very early indeed.\nThis year's Proms will see Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes bring to a close a four-year Beethoven piano concerto project with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.\n\"They knew they would be ending their project in 2015,\" says Blakeman. \"It became clear that they wanted to finish at the Proms with a complete cycle of the concertos.\n\"From there came the idea of doing a complete Prokofiev cycle, albeit in a slightly different way - we are doing them all in one night.\"\nAs it became clear that 2015 would be an important Proms for piano music, the decision was made to include some of Mozart's works as well.\n\"We programmed the late, great concertos for this season,\" says Blakeman.\nBut amid simultaneous discussions with so many top artists - all of them wanting to bring their own choice of repertoire - how is everybody kept happy?\n\"We are very lucky in that people want to come and perform at the Proms,\" Blakeman explains.\n\"So the conversations about which artists will bring what repertoire, and when, are a lot easier to negotiate.\"\nOne of those conversations has been with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which this year plays two Proms back to back in August.\nWith more than 90 musicians, just getting the ensemble across the Atlantic is a \"daunting and exciting\" task - one that falls to the BSO's concert operations manager, Sarah Radcliffe-Marrs.\n\"We'll pack everything up - wardrobe cases, instruments cases, all sorts of equipment we'll need - then everyone will make their way from Boston to the UK,\" she says.\n\"The smaller instruments - violins, flutes, cellos - we bring with us. Double basses have enormous travelling cases. I'm about 5ft 8in and I think I could probably get inside one of them.\n\"Violinists bring one, if not two instruments with them, and several bows - one of our violinists has 10.\"\nThe instruments need careful climate control when they travel and moving everything from place to place requires careful planning. And all that before a hotel check-in for more than 130 people at once.\n\"We have to think about how to give the musicians access to their instruments, because they will want to practise when they arrive,\" says Radcliffe-Marrs.\n\"But we'll be in a hotel, and there is no obvious place to park an instrument truck.\"\nThe aim of this meticulous planning is to deliver the musicians and their instruments to the Royal Albert Hall in the best possible condition to perform.\nAs the orchestra gathers backstage, the audience will be filing into the RAH's cavernous arena, many of them choosing to buy standing tickets on the day.\nAs they make their way into the building they'll be met by the RAH's front of house chief, Julia Robinson.\n\"It's a really exciting time of year for us, we have all these thousands of people coming every single day,\" she says.\n\"We have the buzz of people queuing outside - and people full of very high expectations.\"\nRobinson will spend the final hours before the opening night making sure her staff know how to get the audience into the building as smoothly as possible.\nWith 118,000 tickets sold in just 12 hours this year, there are huge numbers of people to cater for.

Now they are cutting it in Wales.\n\"What it points to is real confusion in the Labour party. They don't really have a clear plan for Wales and I think Wales as a result would suffer with lost jobs, lost investment.\"\nOther parties also criticised the decision with Jenny Willott, for the Liberal Democrats, saying Jobs Growth Wales had been \"ineffective\".\n\"However, for the Welsh Labour Government to allow this scheme to expire without replacing it is staggering,\" she said.\nAnd Ian Johnson, a Plaid Cymru election candidate, added: \"Earlier this year, Ed Miliband said how great the scheme was.\n\"Today, he has been embarrassed by his only government in the UK, who have fundamentally undermined his election pledge to young people.\"\nMeanwhile, UKIP's leader in Wales Nathan Gill called on ministers to \"focus on creating the right conditions for existing businesses to expand and for new businesses to start\".\n\"The only way we will ever truly achieve this is to withdraw from the European Union, which spends each day dreaming up new ways of stifling innovation and creativity in the form of regulations and directives,\" he said.\nBut the Welsh government said it was aiming to launch a new Jobs Growth Wales programme in May saying it has made a \"significant contribution to reducing youth unemployment right across Wales\".\n\"The original programme was designed to create and fill 12,000 jobs and to date it has helped create over 17,000 job opportunities and fill almost 15,000 of these vacancies for young people aged 16-24,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"The European Social Fund budget for the 2007-2013 programme came to an end on 31 March and we have already begun work on the successor programme.\n\"Subject to approval within the new European Social Fund for 2014-2020 we are aiming to launch the new Jobs Growth Wales programme in the first quarter of this financial year.\"\nThe thrust of the criticism here is that if Jobs Growth Wales is so important to the Welsh economy then how come it has been allowed to come to a halt, albeit temporarily, and how come funding has been reduced?\nThe opposition parties have seized on developments partly because barely a week goes by without a member of the Welsh government trumpeting the success of its back-to-work scheme.\nThe Welsh government insists it is not being scrapped and has responded to criticism over continuity by pointing to the fact that anyone about to begin or in the middle of a six-month placement will not be affected.\nIt says officials have already worked up a new scheme and are awaiting approval from the EU within a month.","summary":"A flagship Welsh government youth job creation scheme has been temporarily closed while approval for a new one is awaited from the EU.","id":32233959}

Protests have been relatively small and have not gained the same level of political momentum as those in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria.\nCorrection 25 January 2013: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that members of the Jordanian security forces were allowed to vote for the first time.","summary":"Thousands of Jordanians have attended a protest demanding political reforms in Amman, hours after King Abdullah called early parliamentary elections.","id":19840979}

She had had fertility treatment at another health centre.\nShe was in a stable condition in hospital for more than a fortnight but on 15 October her blood pressure and temperature dropped and her condition worsened.\nAccording to the family's lawyer, one of the foetuses was suffering breathing problems. The lawyer alleges that the gynaecologist refused to abort the foetuses in order to save the mother and said: \"As long as it's alive, I will not intervene.\"\nNo action was taken while the troubled foetus was still alive and hours later both had died, the lawyer said.\nOvernight, the mother's condition deteriorated and she contracted an infection. On 16 October she was transferred to intensive care, where she died.\nAngelo Pellicano, the head of the Cannizzaro hospital, said the lawyer was wrong.\n\"There was no conscientious objection on behalf of the doctor that intervened in this case because there was no voluntary termination of the pregnancy, but (the miscarriage) was forced by the grave circumstances,\" he told the Ansa news agency. \"I rule out that a doctor could have told the family what they say he told them.\"\nSources told Ansa that the doctor had not been registered as a \"conscientious objector\".\nCatania's prosecutor has halted Milluzzo's burial while a post mortem examination is carried out. There are unconfirmed reports that some of the hospital's medical staff may be investigated.\nA senior doctor at the hospital, Paolo Scollo, told the Corriere website that all the doctors in his department were \"objectors\", and external doctors were called in when necessary. \"However, in this case we're talking about a spontaneous miscarriage, no external help was needed. So we do not think the doctor was negligent,\" he said.\nIt emerged earlier this year that the proportion of Italian gynaecologists refusing to carry out abortions in 2013 was 70%, according to Italian government figures.

Consider this list a safe, feel-good haven.\nRule number two: nothing in this list was created specifically to go viral.\nAs in, a committee of advertising executives didn't sit around a room and decide how to spend money on making it a hit.\nOf course, everyone wants their posts to be popular, but let's just say this list is intended to feature some of the more organic fun.\nOff we go!\nOne of the remarkable things about Ruairi McSorley is how he managed to change a tiny soundbite into a media career.\nAsked by UTV reporter Gareth Wilkinson about the weather conditions in Northern Ireland, McSorley's charming accent led to him being dubbed the most Irish man in the world.\nHis \"frostbit\" soundbite has led to countless TV appearances, events and, soon, a charity single.\nIf you're not a fan of American Football - and sometimes even if you are - the half-time show is the most interesting part of the sporting extravaganza.\nAnd not since Janet Jackson's wardrobe \"malfunction\" has their been a more talked about moment than singer Katy Perry's performance.\nShe was joined on stage by two adorable backing dancers, although one of them, the shark on the left, struggled to keep up.\nLeft Shark fever swept the world, coming to symbolise the daily struggles we all face to keep up with the world.\nKaty Perry's lawyers tried to trademark \"left shark\", but were denied.\nAlso in February, a garment now consigned to history as simply \"the dress\" was stirring debate.\nOptical illusion, colour blindness', strange lighting - whatever caused the difference of opinion, the image of the white\/gold or blue\/black dress became one of the most shared of the year.\nAnd then we all agreed it was blue and black. Didn't we?\nIf Katy Perry's Left Shark was a symbol of life's daily struggles, the shot of a weasel hitching a ride on a woodpecker is a reminder of how we should all be able to get along, no matter our differences.\n\"Weasels are fearless,\" commented wildlife expert Lucy Cooke. Evidently!\nAlso in March, shocking footage emerged from Thailand showing an elephant, clearly intoxicated, clambering into a bath.\nDid I say intoxicated? I meant adorable.\nAnnual sense-of-humour-vacuum April Fools' Day brings a flood of prank videos.\nMost are terrible, but some are beautifully executed - like this magic from a maths teacher in California. It racked up an impressive 13 million views.\nMaths was a continuing theme in April.\nThis brain teaser, originally posed to Singaporean schoolchildren, had the world scratching its head and arguing over the solution. Did you figure it out?\n(The answer's on Wikipedia\u2026)\n\"Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing.\"\nSo wrote a poster on 4chan, the notoriously dark online message board. They attached a picture of Sean O'Brien, a large Liverpudlian, who had been dancing at a gig.\nAfter attention was brought to the apparent \"fat-shaming\", the internet rallied round and Mr O'Brien was tracked down.\nIn May, the Dancing Man had a huge party thrown for him in Los Angeles - attended by Monica Lewinsky, Moby and Andrew WK.\n\"I'm still pinching myself,\" Mr O'Brien said.\nBack in London, it was a \"hipster cop\" that had people talking.\nPeter Swinger - who sports a stylish, curly moustache - was spotted on duty at a protest march.\nHowever, according to the Daily Mail, a close relative said Mr Singer, a father of three, was \"definitely not a hipster\".\nWhat a hipster thing to say.\nBehold, the best double-take ever captured on film.\nChampion surfer Mick Fanning waiting just six days to get back into the water after this terrifying incident.\nThe 34-year-old was competing in South Africa when two sharks appeared in the water.\nNo problem for Mr Fanning, though - he just punched one of them and swam off, avoiding probable death.\nKevin Innes found a pile of dog toys in a shop in Norway. And then he pressed them.\nThe Guardian called the resulting clip the \"best thing on the internet today\".\nI'd go as far as declaring it the best thing on the internet this entire year.\nWhy? It sums up the very best thing about viral hits - that ability to give the entire world that \"oh, you had to be there\" experience.\nAlso in August, everyone melted after watching this little lad who definitely isn't going to miss his mum when he's at school.\nThe undoubted star of this next clip is the woman in the passenger seat. Quiet, stoic\u2026 resigned.\nNext to her, the now world-famous Ronnie Pickering.\nWho? Ronnie Pickering. Who? RONNIE PICKERING!\nMr Pickering's road rage was captured on film by cyclist Steve Middleton, and spread around the world as people asked: \"Who's Ronnie Pickering?\"\nThe video can be viewed here, but be warned it contains a flood of swear words.\nMr Pickering's son later took to Twitter to say his Dad's a great guy and a great laugh. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt - we all have our off days.\nMeanwhile, in September, this Manhattan rat was having the \"on\" day to end them all.\nIn this internet age, it's quite reassuring that the humble music video format still has the ability to get people talking.\nThough now, it's not enough to merely like a music video - you have to remix it.\nHip hop artist\/dancing visionary Drake's video for Hotline Bling spawned hundreds of remakes.\nTo save you the time, just watch this one - it's by far the best.\nFor a short while in October it seemed that every cat owner in the world was buying up cucumbers to scare their cats.\n(Although it must be said that experts later advised against it - it's pretty mean.)\nThere are numerous theories as to why cats seem to jump out of their skin at the sight of a cucumber - one expert, speaking to ABC News, said it's because cats are genetically wired to bounce away from snakes.\nEver since the demise of CBBC's Record Breakers, the public's appetite for world-beaters has been left unsatisfied.\nGood job we've got Otto, then, a bulldog who rode a skateboard through the legs of 30 people.\nIf there's one thing we've learned this year, it's that being Irish increases your viral potential by roughly 100x.\nHere, TV news reporter Teresa Mannion took to the coastline of Galway, in the west of Ireland, to broadcast to RTE viewers.\nBut Storm Desmond had other ideas, giving poor Ms Mannion a right blustering.\n\"Don't swim in the sea!\" she screamed in her dramatic live report. And then the internet got to work.\nAnd on Christmas Day, a lot of Dads fell off their hoverboards.\nSo, there we have it. An eclectic year of road rage, Irishness, dresses and sharks of varying ferocity.\nThe next year could see big changes to the internet.\nDebates on encryption and censorship may alter the very fabric of how this series of tubes works.\nBut through it all, let's hope we keep our sense of humour and not take ourselves too seriously.

They gave this discretionary fund to the Bloody Sunday families... they gave this discretionary fund to the Hillsborough families,\" she said\n\"The English legal aid agency funded English lawyers to make a case in Northern Ireland for a civil case for some of the Omagh bombing families... so why oh why are we having to fight and beg with a bowl to get what everyone else has had?\"\nLawyers for the families - from KRW in Northern Ireland - have been working for free, while legal teams for police and other government branches have been taxpayer-funded.\nWest Midlands Police has already set aside \u00c2\u00a31m to cover its legal costs.\nIn court on Monday was human rights lawyer Gareth Peirce, who is believed to be representing the surviving members of the Birmingham Six as well as representatives for West Midlands Police, the local Police Federation, and Devon and Cornwall Police.\nThe government had rejected a call from the families for a special funding model similar to that used in the Hillsborough Stadium disaster inquiry.\nInstead, Home Secretary Amber Rudd backed the relatives making an application under existing arrangements through the Legal Aid Agency.\nHowever, under rules governing the UK's separate legal jurisdictions, the families' Northern Ireland-based lawyers KRW Law would need to partner with an English law firm to secure legal aid.\nA government spokesman said \"our deepest sympathies remain with the families\" and said the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) had been clear with KRW about how to \"take this matter forward\".\n\"Legal aid is a devolved matter and because KRW is based in Northern Ireland, it needs to enter into an arrangement with an English or Welsh law firm in order to receive legal aid funding.\n\"The LAA continues to urge KRW to do this so the families get the representation they want at the inquest.\"","summary":"Relatives of the Birmingham pub bombings victims have said they cannot understand why they are having to fight to get funding for their legal fees.","id":38128323}

{"document":"The government is currently negotiating with the Lib Dems and Greens to strike a deal to get its budget plans passed.\nGreen co-convener Patrick Harvie has asked for concessions over tax, while Lib Dem Willie Rennie has targeted up to \u00a3400m of additional spending.\nFinance Secretary Derek Mackay has said he is \"positive\" about winning support.\nWith the SNP a minority government, they will need at least one opposition party to help the budget pass, either by voting for it or by abstaining.\nMr Mackay has indicated a budget deal with the Conservatives or Labour is unlikely, but said there was \"room for manoeuvre\" in talks with the Lib Dems and Greens.\nAnd while he has said no matters are \"absolutely closed\", he wants to \"adhere as close to the [SNP] manifesto as possible\" on tax, making a deal with the Lib Dems the more likely.\nThe Lib Dems said they wanted \"substantial changes\" made, which would \"set Scotland on a stronger, more liberal path\".\nThese focus on the party's manifesto pledges around education and mental health. Specific measures include:\nMr Rennie said: \"Liberal Democrats will not agree to the draft budget as it stands and will need these substantial changes. If we don't get what the country needs then we will walk away.\n\"Our plan invests for a step change in mental health and a transformation in education that will help in the road to a liberal Scotland. A properly funded pupil premium and more money for colleges will create that opportunity and boost jobs and the economy.\n\"New investment in mental health services will boost this Cinderella service and make the whole NHS more sustainable in the future. We have also included support for alcohol and drug services, a higher budget for the police and lower cost transport for the Northern Isles.\n\"I have had a number of meetings and discussions with the finance secretary so far and I am looking forward to receiving his response to our plan.\"\nMr Mackay has defended his tax and spending plans in two meetings of the finance committee, where he also took questions from the public over social media.\nThe committee will submit its report on the budget on Friday 27 January, with the first chamber debate on the budget the following week.\nThe final vote on the budget will follow a separate vote on Mr Mackay's tax proposals, in the week beginning 20 February.\nThis is a decent snapshot of what the final budget deal is likely to look like.\nWillie Rennie probably won't get absolutely everything he is asking for - one would suspect Derek Mackay is too good a negotiator for that - but this is a far more palatable list of demands for the finance secretary than that put forward by the Greens, who want to see some movement over tax.\nWhile he says nothing is off the table, Mr Mackay isn't going to budge on tax. He sees his current proposals as well-balanced, and endorsed by the electorate last May.\nAnd with a deal with Labour or the Tories more or less dismissed in advance on political grounds, that leaves Mr Rennie as the clear favourite.\nHe may well have beefed up his demands accordingly - minus any red lines, of course, over tax.\nThere are plenty of talks still to come, but there is also plenty common ground here.

{"document":"They say the lengths of tiny pieces of DNA called telomeres indicate whether a young creature is likely to live long into old age.\nBut before you rush out to get your telomeres stretched - were such a process possible - it is worth pointing out that the creatures they have been working with are not humans but altogether shorter-lived zebra finches.\nEverything that is made up of living cells contains chromosomes: the genetic code that makes us what we are.\nAt the ends of each chromosome lie the telomeres. They have been likened to the caps on the ends of shoelaces - they stop things from unravelling.\nOver time they wear down - and when they do, the DNA they protect is compromised and the cell can malfunction or die.\nThis is where the zebra finches came in: how early and accurately could longer telomeres predict a longer life?\nTo find out, the Glasgow researchers collaborated with colleagues at Exeter University, with Glasgow's Prof Pat Monaghan leading the team.\nTiny blood samples were taken from a group of 99 zebra finches and the lengths of their telomeres measured. They were tested again throughout their lifetimes.\nTo find out how long the birds lived, the researchers had to wait until they died.  The first turned up its claws in just over six months.  But the last hardy specimen kept them waiting almost nine years.\nIn every case the longest lived birds had the longest telomeres, but the best predictor of lifespan was the length of the telomeres at just 25 days old.\nProf Monaghan says the study shows the importance of processes acting early in life.\nThe next step will be to find out why the length of telomeres can vary so much from individual to individual.\n\"We now need to know more about how early life conditions can influence the pattern of telomere loss and the relative importance of inherited and environmental factors,\" she said.\nThe results of the research have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA.\nThey are certain to raise the question of whether our telomeres are similar predictors of how long we will live.\nBut it is a big leap from the laboratory to the real world - whatever our telomeres may say, human lifespans also have to contend with additional factors like diet, drink and stress.\nWild finches, meanwhile, have snakes and birds of prey to worry about.\nThe bottom line for now?

{"document":"And one of those groupings is the evangelical wing - a deeply conservative grouping that will play such an important role in Iowa, the first state to vote in February next year - and therefore disproportionately important. So you are going to say things this Christian community in the Midwest state wants to hear. You are going to do things that are none too subtle. You might even do a bit of pandering to them.\nDonald Trump went on stage this weekend clutching the bible his mother had given him. It was a new prop for him to use. That's politics. You do what you need to do. But equally there are lines you just do not cross. And in the past two days, two of the Republican hopefuls, it seems, have done just that - one stumbled across the line, the other leapt across it so egregiously that it is causing reverberations.\nThe slight trip across the line came from the aforementioned Mr Trump who failed to correct a questioner who alleged that Obama wasn't American, wasn't a Christian - but was a Muslim.  Mr Trump, under fire, countered that it wasn't up to him - he had no moral responsibility to stand up for the president. OK, but you can correct a downright lie. No?\nThe full scale leap across the line that would have made an Olympic long jumper proud came from the mild-mannered, hitherto Mr Nice of this race, Dr Ben Carson. He was asked on Meet the Press whether his faith should matter. If you haven't heard it I am going to reprint here the full exchange with Chuck Todd the interviewer, just so you can see that the comments aren't being taken out of context.\nTODD: Should a president's faith matter? Should it matter to voters?\nCARSON: I guess it depends on what that faith is. If it's inconsistent with the values and principles of America. And of course, if it fits within the realm of America and consistent with the constitution, no problem.\nTODD: So do you believe that Islam is consistent with the constitution?\nCARSON: No, I do not. I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.\nAnd just so we can deal with the substantive point that Dr Carson raises, let us just detain ourselves for a moment longer on what is and what is not constitutional. Article 6 is just about as explicit a statement as you're ever going to find: no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\nI don't know whether Dr Carson's words will bolster his position among the base after a somewhat lacklustre performance in the Republican debate last week at the Ronald Reagan Library - but what about the feelings of the three million Muslims who live in America? How is it going to feel to have a serious political figure, someone who aspires to lead this nation, essentially saying being Muslim is un-American?\nThese people who day in, day out serve their communities, support their families, enrich the lives of fellow citizens and make America the successful melting pot that it is. Kids who recite the pledge of allegiance in the morning at their schools and go to their mosque or church or synagogue in the evening at the weekend? Isn't that what America is all about?  Which bit of \"one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all\" doesn't Dr Carson get?\nIndeed, how different are Dr Carson's comments from previous generations of bigots, racists and apologists who would say there could never be an African-American as president, or Catholic, or any other minority you could single out.\nIt is worth looking back at the major piece of work that the Republican leadership undertook after the party's defeat in the 2012 general election, and the reasons why people had shunned it. One of the conclusions of this major piece of research, called the Growth and Opportunity Project, was as follows:\n\"Public perception of the Party is at record lows. Young voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the Party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country. When someone rolls their eyes at us, they are not likely to open their ears to us.\"\nI was in California for the second Republican debate last week, and to be honest I thought Dr Ben Carson was sailing in a bit of an empty vessel. I couldn't remember anything noteworthy that he had said. Well, we now see that there is something in that vessel, aside from him. And it is not very pleasant. It will be interesting to watch how much pressure there'll be for him to walk the plank, or chart a very different course.","summary":"Look, I'm not a total na\u00c3\u00aff.

This is due to the inclusion and diversity requirements mandated by the recently introduced Code for Sports Governance.\nOn a more fundamental level, Rabbatts wants the FA to lead by example when it comes to BME coaches and managers.

{"document":"\"The documentary for me started with the questions: 'Is this the end of film? Is digital going to replace it? What are we losing if that happens and what are we gaining?,'\" says Keanu Reeves.\nThe actor serves as producer, narrator and interviewer on Side by Side, in which he sets out to examine cinema's transition from film to digital formats.\nIt seems a niche subject, but Reeves and director Chris Kenneally say they were conscious about making the film for a mainstream audience.\n\"We wanted to take something that was quite specialised and share enough information so people could understand what we'd be speaking about,\" Reeves says.\nBut does the average cinema-goer care or notice what format the film they're watching is in?\n\"If you're not an aficionado, probably not, as long as it was working,\" admits Reeves.\n\"If you go and expect to see a Hollywood studio movie and it looked terrible you'd go like, 'what is that?' So I think it could impact in that sense.\n\"But a perfect film print projected is something that is remarkable and unique.\"\nSide By Side makes no assumptions that audiences will know the technical aspects of filmmaking, so spends some time explaining how cameras work, the photochemical process of developing film and how the introduction of digital cameras has led to the progression of editing and special effects.\nAnd helping to explain is a cast that reads like a Who's Who of cinema.\nDirectors Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, David Lynch, James Cameron, Danny Boyle, George Lucas and cinematographers Wally Pfister (Inception, The Dark Knight) and Roger Deakins (Skyfall, True Grit) are all present.\nFemale filmmakers are represented by the likes of legendary editor Anne Coates, who worked on movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Elephant Man and Lena Dunham, one of Hollywood's hottest talents thanks to her TV show Girls.\nReeves conducted a large share of the interviews himself, which not only helped the filmmakers gain such unprecedented access but also made for a series of relaxed, open conversations.\n\"I can't say it didn't help that I've been in the industry for however many years - I was a known quantity in that sense,\" he says.\nIt took around 18 months to round up and interview all the film-makers. Luckily, a large number of contributors attended an annual cinematography festival in Poland.\nHowever others weren't so easy to get. Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino are notably absent.\n\"There were people who weren't available or who didn't want to speak,\" he says. \"We got turned down a few times which sucked.\"\nAlthough mainstream Hollywood films have been shot digitally for about the last 12 years, the first digital film to win an Oscar for best cinematography was Slumdog Millionaire in 2009.\nCinematography Oscars followed for Avatar in 2010 and Hugo in 2011 - also shot digitally.\nSome see this as a shift in the attitude towards digital film, which had previously been considered inferior in quality.\nFilming on celluloid is an expensive and time consuming process. Reels of film that each contain about 10 minutes of footage are developed overnight, creating \"dailies\". Viewing them is the first chance a director will get to see the product of his previous day's work.\nIt is only then they discover if they have the right shots or if they have to go back and re-shoot.\nThe advent of video cameras showed not only that film-making could be done at a fraction of the cost, but that you could see the results immediately. It also enabled anyone to effectively become a film-maker.\nThe invention of low price digital cameras further democratised the film-making process.\nHowever, advocates for celluloid include Inception director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister, who maintain digital images will never have the depth or clarity of film, which they insist on using.\nOn the other side, the likes of George Lucas, James Cameron and David Lynch profess their love for digital and swear they'll never go back.\nAnother issue addressed in the documentary is digital film archiving and preservation - where the introduction of new formats every couple of years is proving to be problematic.\nIndeed, Se7en director David Fincher says he has videos from the early days of his career in unplayable formats, as the hardware no longer exists.\nAs a result, when he finishes a film, he now stores the relevant player alongside the rushes in his archive, to ensure he is able to watch them back at a later date.\nAnd even with modern technology, hard drives can fail, leading to the loss of digital content.\nIt is something Reeves admits he had not considered. \"I had no idea about the situation we're in right now where there is no standardised means of archiving digital information.\"\n\"I didn't know anything about how it could all just go away - it was a bit jaw-dropping.\"\nThe irony is that celluloid is the only format that has stood the test of time over the past 100 years and will continue to do so as long as there are projectors to play them on.\nThroughout Side by Side, Reeves maintains his impartiality but with filming complete, he is able to share his thoughts.\n\"Going into the film I was definitely biased to 'what are we losing?'. Film was being held up as the gold standard and digital was this idea of replacing [it],\" he says.\n\"But what I've come to learn is that it's not necessarily replacing it - but that it's something else. And if it is that, then film has a better chance.\n\"I'm still confident that it's going to hang around.\"\nSide By Side is out in cinemas from Friday, 15 February through Axiom Films.","summary":"Documentary Side by Side looks at the history of film-making and whether the advent of digital technology spells the end of celluloid.","id":21457702}

{"document":"They are young and clever, and they want to change the world - one bus at a time.\n\"We've created the world's first bus that runs on formic acid, which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen, yet it delivers the same environmental benefits,\" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast, a spin-off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.\n\"We're building our own future.\"\nAround 40 of his fellow students are endeavouring to develop emissions-free transport that will help in the global battle against climate change. And they're also trying to create careers for themselves.\nFormic acid is found in nature, delivered in the stings and bites of ants and other insects - the Latin word for ant is formica.\nAnd this simple carboxylic acid (chemical formula HCOOH) is already used in textiles and leather processing, as a livestock feed preservative, and is also found in some household limescale removers.\nBut Team Fast has found a way the acid can efficiently carry the ingredients needed for hydrogen fuel cells, used to power electric vehicles.\nThe fuel, which the team has dubbed hydrozine (not to be confused with hydrazine), is a liquid, which means you can transport it easily and refill vehicles quickly, as with conventional fuels.\nThe difference is that it is much cleaner.\n\"The tailpipe emissions are only CO2 and water,\" explains Mr van Cappellen. \"No other harmful gases like nitric oxides, soot or sulphuric oxides are emitted.\"\nTo prove the concept in the real world, an electric bus is set to hit the road in the Netherlands later this year, where it will shuttle between running on conventional bus routes and appearing at promotional events and industry fairs.\nThe bus has an electric drive system, developed by bus builder VDL, that receives additional power from the formic acid fuel cell system mounted in a range-extender trailer, towed behind.\n\"Our tank is around 300 litres, so we will extend the range of the bus by 200km (180 miles). However, we could of course make the tank bigger very easily,\" says Mr van Cappellen.\nCurrent hydrogen fuel cell buses have a range of up to 400km.\nBut why develop a bus rather than a car?\n\"If we built a car, we would compete with electric cars, but we believe battery-powered cars are a good solution for a lot of people,\" says Mr van Cappellen.\n\"But if we prove that we can build a bus that meets the needs of bus companies, with a range of around 400km and quick refuelling, we will have shown the potential of hydrozine in a segment where there is no sustainable competition yet.\"\nHydrozine is created through a chemical reaction between water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2).\nMore Technology of Business\n\"In a reactor, water and CO2 are bonded using sustainable electricity. This is a direct, sustainable electrochemical process,\" explains Mr van Cappellen.\nThe hydrozine is then broken down by a catalyst into hydrogen and carbon dioxide inside a piece of kit called a reformer that Team Fast is attempting to patent.\nIts newly designed reformer is a tenth of the size of reformers of the past, which is why \"it is now applicable in transport applications for the first time\".\nThe hydrogen is then added to a fuel cell where it reacts with oxygen to generate the electricity that powers the electric motor.\n\"We are continuously looking for new technologies that can extend the range of zero emissions traffic in a simple way,\" says Menno Kleingeld, managing director, VDL Enabling Transport Solutions.\n\"The decomposition of formic acid into hydrogen gas is one of these new, promising technologies.\"\nBut does it really stand a chance of becoming commercially viable?\n\"It costs about 35,000 euros (\u00c2\u00a330,000) to convert a conventional petrol filling station to a hydrozine filling station, a process that essentially involves replacing the pipes and coating the tanks,\" says Mr van Cappellen.\nAs such, it is \"100 times cheaper\" to roll out a fuelling network for hydrozine than for gaseous hydrogen, he maintains.\n\"Hydrozine is currently cheaper than petrol and more expensive than diesel in the Netherlands, and in future we expect prices to come down so it will be cheaper than both,\" he adds.\nAlthough the bus emits CO2, Team Fast argues that the original CO2 used to create the hydrozine is taken from existing sources, such as air or exhaust fumes, so that no additional CO2 is produced - it's a closed carbon cycle in the jargon.\nSome experts believe the technology shows promise.\n\"Team Fast has a very good project,\" says Professor Richard van de Sanden, head of the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research.\n\"It works on a very important issue: the storing of renewable energy in a transportable form and in a form which can actually be used.\"\nAnd several companies are supporting the project.\n\"What we're working on together is a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture,\" says Martijn de Graaff, senior business development manager at TNO Industry.\n\"If we achieve this it will give us a stable future.\"\nThe students' own commitment is impressive, with 15 of the 40 working full time on the project, and the rest contributing at least 20-25 hours per week.\n\"We don't get study points for it, but you can only learn so much at university about the practical experience of things,\" Mr van Cappellen says.\n\"It's our own future we're making.\"","summary":"A group of students has developed a way of storing energy that could be cheaper to make, more practical and more sustainable than alternative renewable fuels.","id":40403351}

{"document":"US academics have produced international comparisons in key subjects - using tests taken in 2011 by 900,000 pupils in over 60 countries.\nIt shows that Northern Ireland is Europe's top performing education system for primary maths.\nEngland has slipped in science, but is top 10 for primary and secondary maths.\nThe top places in this global education league table have been taken by Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. Finland is among the highest placed European countries.\nSuch comparisons have become increasingly influential - measuring pupils against the standards of international competitor countries.\nGlobalisation in the jobs market and the economy has seen education ministers wanting to benchmark pupils' achievement against current international rivals.\nSuch international rankings have also highlighted the educational strength underpinning the emerging economic powers in Asia.\nThese latest rankings bring together two major studies - the four-yearly Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the five-yearly Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).\nThey reveal the continuing pattern of domination by a group of Asian education systems - South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong (such international comparisons include regional school systems as well as countries).\nBut the study, compiled by researchers at Boston College in the US, shows that England and Northern Ireland are performing strongly in the following group of European education systems.\nSource: TIMSS 2011\nIn maths, the study says England has been one of the most improved between 1995 and 2011. England remains in the global top 10 for maths - in 9th for primary and 10th for secondary.\nEngland has slipped in primary science tests, taken by 600,000 10 year olds - down to 15th place from 7th place in the last tests in 2007. There was also a dip for secondary science, taken by 14 year olds, down from 5th to 9th place.\nIn the literacy tests, taken by a sample of 325,000 primary school pupils, there was progress for England - up from 15th to 11th.\nA spokesman for Education Secretary Michael Gove said: \"These tests reflect progress between 2006 and 2011 and were taken only a year after the election.\n\"So to the limited extent the results reflect the effect of political leadership, Labour deserves the praise for the small improvement in reading and the blame for the stagnation in maths and the decline in science. The tests say nothing, good or bad, about what we have done.\"\nLabour's education spokesman, Stephen Twigg, said: \"These results show schools in England are some of the best in Europe - thanks to the hard work of teachers and pupils. The Labour government's reforms saw reading results improve thanks to better teaching, smaller class sizes and Labour's National Literacy Strategy.\nSource: TIMSS 2011\n\"However, we need to understand why East Asian countries out perform us in key skills - particularly science and maths.\"\nMr Twigg also highlighted the lower achievement for Sweden in reading - linking it to the free schools inspired by the Swedish education system.\nThere was a particularly strong performance for Northern Ireland - in 6th place for primary maths, which meant it was the highest ranking European school system.\nNorthern Ireland, taking part in these tests for the first time, is in 5th place for primary reading - in a top group alongside such education superpowers such as Finland and Hong Kong.\nIn terms of the proportion of pupils reaching the highest ability levels, Northern Ireland was even more successful, in 3rd place.\nThe maths study also ranked the \"safe and orderly\" levels of schools - and found Northern Ireland was at the top, with England in 14th place.\nThere was also a ranking of bullying for the primary maths study - with England having one of the worst records in Europe, in 30th place in terms of students' views of the levels of bullying.\nScotland and Wales did not take part in these rankings.\nSuch results show long-term trends, overlapping between different governments and education ministers. In England, the tests were taken under the current coalition government, but the pupils would have studied under the reforms of the previous Labour government.\nSource: PIRLS 2011\nResearchers say the factors linked to success are a supportive home background and schools which have good discipline and experienced and well-motivated teachers. They also mention negative social factors, such as too many older pupils having learning impaired by a lack of adequate sleep.\nThe maths study examined the availability of resources at home - such as books - with pupils in South Korea, Norway, Sweden and the US being the best equipped. Indonesia and Ghana had the least learning materials at home.\nThere is a broad pattern repeated across these tables, with a cluster of Asian, Pacific Rim, countries at the top, European and western countries in the upper and middle ranks, with countries in North Africa and the Middle East in the lower ranks.\nReport author and Boston College professor, Michael Martin, said that the success of the top-performing countries reflects the long-term investment - and shows the way for other developing countries to follow.\n\"Education is a multi-generational enterprise,\" he said.\n\"One thing you can learn from these is what's possible. That comes as a shock sometimes, what students in other countries can actually do and the gap sometimes between what your students are achieving and what students in other countries are achieving,\" said Prof Martin.\nThere are other international rankings - but these also show a similar picture at the top of the table, with education systems such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Finland and England among the highest performers.\nIn global league tables assembled by Pearson last month, Finland and South Korea were top, with England in 6th place.\nThe less expected success of the TIMSS and PIRLS rankings will be the high performance of Russia, which has a place in all their top 10s.\nAnother prominent international ranking, the PISA tests run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has shown a strong performance for Chinese education systems, including Shanghai and Hong Kong.","summary":"Asian countries have taken top places in global school rankings for maths, science and reading, with England and Northern Ireland among high performers.","id":20664752}

It would follow the model introduced for the 16% of households that use pre-payment meters.\nSince April, these customers have had their bills capped, according to where they live in the country.\nOfgem would base the precise level of the cap on the cheapest standard variable tariffs in each part of the UK, taking into account the variable costs for transporting energy there.\nIn other words, the cap would vary in different parts of the country and be re-set every six months.\nAbout 17 million households would be affected. They consist of customers who are on standard variable tariffs, which are typically much more expensive than fixed-rate deals.\nOfgem and consumer groups have repeatedly tried to persuade more people to switch to the cheaper deals, but with limited success. As a result, 66% of consumers remain on standard variable tariffs.\nThe remaining 8.5 million customers who have switched to cheaper deals would not be affected by the cap immediately. However, if the industry has its profitability constrained by a cap on variable tariffs, it is likely that the very cheapest deals would disappear.\nYes. There will still be cheaper deals on offer, but the concern is that the savings - compared with the most expensive tariffs - will be smaller than they are now.\nAs the chart above clearly shows, there is some evidence that this is already happening. Since the middle of last year, the gap between the cheapest tariffs and the most expensive have been narrowing. SSE, for example, has raised its cheapest dual fuel deal by 37% since October last year, according to the comparison site Uswitch.\nHowever, consumer groups believe fewer people would switch supplier if there was cap - as there might be less incentive to do so.\nPrices are likely to rise for some, especially those on fixed-rate deals. For the majority, prices will be capped. But should wholesale costs rise, it's worth remembering that Ofgem will raise the level of the cap, so it is possible that all prices will rise anyway.\nEqually well, the level of the cap could fall, cutting bills for those on svts.\nThe truth is that suppliers will try to adjust prices to maintain their profit margins. According to Lazarus Research, the profit margins of five of the big six suppliers rose to 5.6% last year - the largest since 2009.\nIn February, shadow chancellor John McDonnell promised that Labour would also introduce a cap on energy charges.\nHowever at this stage, we do not know how this would work. In the 2015 election, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, promised to freeze prices for a 20-month period.","summary":"The Conservatives have released more details about their proposed cap on energy prices.","id":39855747}

The area will comprise the Chinese section of immigration and customs and the waiting hall for departure passengers, as well as all platforms and trains.\nFull Chinese law, both criminal and civil, will prevail in this entire area, even though it is physically located on Hong Kong soil.\nHong Kong officials say the area will be considered to be outside the territorial boundary of Hong Kong.\nThere will be immigration, customs, quarantine, administration and police officers stationed in the area.\nHong Kong has a separate legal system from mainland China, under the One Country Two Systems framework.\nUnder this Basic Law, Hong Kongers have a far greater degree of freedom to protest than mainland citizens have, among other differences.\nMainland officials also have no jurisdiction in the territory.\nCritics say the proposal could lead to Hong Kongers being arrested on Hong Kong soil for actions which are legal here, but not in mainland China.\nIt also feeds in to growing concern in recent years about Chinese encroachment into Hong Kong affairs, after the disappearance from Hong Kong of several people who sold books critical of the Chinese government, and the removal of several MPs who had protested against Beijing while being sworn in.\nIt is currently unclear whether Western social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which are blocked in mainland China, will be accessible within the port area.\nThe Hong Kong government proposal must be approved by Chinese authorities, before it can be implemented in Hong Kong through a change or addition in local legislation.\nPro-democracy legislators say they will try to veto the plan.","summary":"Hong Kong's government has unveiled a controversial plan which would allow Chinese mainland law to apply in the territory for the first time.","id":40712984}

But now that Apple has scaled so many peaks the worry is that the only way is down - and there's evidence in these figures to back up those concerns.\nSales of the iPhone, surely the single most profitable product any company has produced, were basically flat. What's more,  the revenue outlook for the next three months indicates we can expect the first fall in sales since the iPhone's 2007 launch.\nThen there's China - still growing but far more slowly. The iPhone is still an object of desire there, but at a time when Apple says it's seeing softness in the economy, the attractions of cheaper rivals from local firms like Xiaomi may grow.\nOf course, the worries about \"peak iPhone\" have surfaced before and evaporated with the hugely successful iPhone 6. Last year's upgrade to the 6S was a minor one, and we can expect something more radical in September.\nBut the pressure is now mounting on Apple to deliver another blockbuster product to keep the profit engine running.\nThe Apple watch will not fill that role - we've still not even heard any sales figures for the product.\nPerhaps the 1,000 engineers rumoured to be working on an Apple Car will come up with the exciting innovation which Apple's fans and investors await with growing impatience.\nIs the mighty iPhone in decline?\nApple boss Tim Cook credited \"all-time record sales of iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV\" for the performance.\nBut the firm's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company was operating in \"a very difficult macroeconomic environment\".\nHe added that \"iPhone units will decline in the quarter\" and that the company was not projecting beyond those three months.\nMr Maestri partly blamed the strong US dollar for Apple's flat sales, estimating it had knocked $5bn off the company's revenues.\nApple's sales in Greater China - defined by the company as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - rose 14%, but that was much slower than the 70% increase a year ago.\nMr Maestri said the softness in China was \"something that we have not seen before\", Reuters reported.\nChina accounts for almost a quarter of Apple's sales, more than all of Europe combined.\nThe profitability of Apple's business improved, with gross margin - or how much the company makes per product - increasing to 40.1%.\nGeoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple was \"generating industry defying margins\" and had cash of almost $216bn.\nSpeaking to analysts, Mr Cook said the company had \"the mother of all balance sheets\" and that its financial position had never been stronger.\nApple's shares were down 2.7% in after hours trading at $97.28.\nDaniel Ives, an analyst at Capital Markets who owns shares in Apple, said given the \"white knuckles fears\" ahead of the results, he would \"characterise the overall headline performance as better than feared\".","summary":"Apple has reported the slowest growth in iPhone sales since the product's 2007 launch and warned sales will fall for the first time later this year.","id":35412892}

The win feels extra special because of the tough losses.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMurray was playing his 11th Grand Slam final and for the first time he was the favourite, having faced either Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer in the previous 10 finals.\nHe appeared to relish the role, ignoring the magnitude of the occasion to claim a sixth successive win over Raonic.\nThe 25-year-old Canadian was making his Grand Slam final debut, helped along the way by John McEnroe, who was in the opposite coaching corner to his old rival Ivan Lendl.\nWhatever insights those two legends were able to pass on, the final came down, as expected, to a contest between serve and return, with the latter coming out on top.\nRaonic went into the match with 137 aces, but it took him five games to add a 138th as Murray dialled in early on the return, just as he had in winning their Queen's Club final three weeks ago.\nA blustery wind on Centre Court was not helping the Raonic serve and he was under pressure early on, seeing off two break points before Murray converted a third to lead 4-3.\nThat was enough to give the Scot the set and he continued to press in the second, earning four chances to break again but finding the net each time.\nRaonic was unable to respond, failing to conjure up a single break point, but a tie-break offered the Canadian a chance to serve his way back to level terms.\nMurray was having none of it, taking advantage of a slightly fortuitous early break to surge ahead with some magnificent defence and a rasping backhand winner.\nAt 6-1 down, there was no way back for Raonic - and when Murray clinched his third set point even the implacable Lendl was moved to applaud.\nAn unexpectedly routine contest came to life at the start of the third set when Raonic finally had two break points, only for a fired-up Murray to play his way out of trouble.\nThe world number two pumped his fist and roared in the direction of his player box, and when it came down to another tie-break, Murray again found his very best when it counted.\nA brilliant backhand winner set him on the way to another 6-1 lead and, with the crowd chanting \"Andy! Andy!\", he pummelled a forehand into the corner on his second match point that Raonic could only return into the net.\nIn his previous 10 Grand Slam finals, Murray had only won 67% of his first-serve points - but it was a different story against Raonic as he won 87% of the points behind it.\nHe was not afraid to direct the majority of his serves to Raonic's strength, the forehand, and incredibly only lost one point when he did so in the match. In fact, over the course of both tie-breaks, Murray directed every first serve to the Raonic forehand.\nThe fact Murray was able to hold so comfortably throughout the match - he only faced two break points - meant that he could be ultra aggressive when returning.\nHe was able get 74% of his returns back in play and put pressure on the Raonic serve, which suffered under pressure, especially in the tie-break where the Canadian only won 44% of his service points.\nMurray's ability to continually return the huge Raonic serve proved key to his victory.\nThe Canadian fired down the biggest serve of the tournament at 147mph, but it was still not enough, the Briton winning the point with a brilliant pass.\n\"He moves incredibly well, he returns well - those are his two biggest strengths, and he's been playing well,\" said Raonic.\n\"Every time you play him, you know he's going to get more returns back than anyone else, along with Novak.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBoris Becker, three-time Wimbledon champion: \"Obviously, the big one is always the first one and once you break that duck there's room for more.

{"document":"The news comes as a major boost to Britain's technology sector.\nSundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, told the BBC that the UK was still an attractive place to do business.\nHe said open borders and free movement for skilled migrants were \"absolutely\" important to the success of the technology sector in the UK.\nIt was Mr Pichai's first European broadcast interview since he became chief executive last year.\nSources at the technology company also said if barriers were thrown up to skilled immigration following the vote to leave the European Union, some of Google's investment could be at risk.\nTurning to the \"fake news\" controversy in America - and choosing his words very carefully - Mr Pichai said that, at the margin, false stories about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton could have affected the outcome of the US election as the margins were \"very narrow\".\nAnd that it was important that companies like Google and other social media businesses promoted \"accurate\" stories to their billions of users.\nAlthough Google refused to be drawn on the cost of the UK investment, development experts said the new building in King's Cross and the cost of employing thousands more staff was likely to put the figure at over \u00a31bn.\nAt present, Google employs around 4,000 people in the UK, a figure that could now rise to 7,000.\nThe office space owned by Google in King's Cross will more than double.\n\"The UK has been a tremendous market for us,\" Mr Pichai told me.\n\"We see big opportunities here. This is a big commitment from us - we have some of the best talent in the world in the UK and to be able to build great products from here sets us up well for the long term.\"\nThe new 650,000 sq-ft headquarters has been designed by Thomas Heatherwick, the designer behind the \"garden bridge\" across the Thames.\nHe was brought in by Google after its founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, rejected initial designs for a new headquarters as \"too boring\" in 2013. Danish architects Bjarke Ingels Group are also involved in the project.\nMany companies raised fears before the referendum that if Britain voted to leave the European Union, foreign investment would be affected.\nQuestions were raised over whether Google would commit to the new building.\nBut Mr Pichai made it clear the strength of the UK economy went far beyond the Brexit vote.\n\"The innovation we see here, the talent we have available here and how on the cutting edge of technology we are able to be here makes it an incredible place for us to invest,\" he said.\n\"We do value how open and connected it is and we can bring in talent from anywhere in the world and we value those attributes and we are optimistic that those will stay true over time.\n\"So we did [make the investment decision] taking into consideration [the referendum], but we are very optimistic.\"\nHe said Brexit may have complicated \"secondary effects\" over the longer term but it was too early to say what they may be.\nI asked Mr Pichai what the government's approach should be to immigration controls.\n\"I want to be respectful,\" he answered.\n\"These are important questions for the citizens of the UK to answer.\n\"I think there are thoughtful debates to be had.\n\"In our experience as a company, when we have been able to bring people together and operate in an open and connected way it achieves tremendous impact over time.\n\"Those are the values we cherish, and we have been open and public about how we think about these things.\n\"When I look at London [I see] a place in which we are able to attract great talent, find great talent in the UK, thanks to a great educational system here, but it has also been a place where people are willing to come from anywhere in the world.\n\"Increasingly, for the kinds of complex things we do, we need to bring people who are across many disciplines - with many different backgrounds - together to solve problems. That's how you can build newer things, so that is particularly important for us.\"\nHe said that he would \"worry\" if controls on skilled migration were made more stringent.\nTurning to events in America and the election of Donald Trump, Mr Pichai said it was clear the country was \"deeply divided\".\n\"I come from India, I am used to a vibrant democracy, and it is the same in the United States.\n\"It is important to remember that we had a democratic process and there has been an outcome.\n\"As you can see the country is deeply divided so I tend to look forward and I think we need to figure out how to constructively engage with the new administration and hear the voices of people, as at Google we care about certain values - be it freedom of expression, the notion of inclusion and fairness, building open systems, building a connected world.\n\"But it is also important to acknowledge that there are people, through a process like this, who feel left behind, and I am glad the democratic process gives voices to everyone.\"\nI asked him if the atmosphere in America had become nastier during the campaign and in its aftermath.\n\"The rhetoric, for sure, did bother me, as it did many people during the election but I am hopeful there are a lot of founding principles - what makes the US the country it is - and I hope post the campaign season, as we move back into a governing phase, I think people will come together and we have a lot of important problems to work through.\"\nFollowing the presidential election, Facebook and Google have faced protests over the dissemination of \"fake news\", with their computer systems often promoting stories about Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton that were false.\nSome have even suggested that the stories may have affected the way people voted, and ultimately, the outcome of the vote, an argument dismissed by Mark Zuckerberg as \"pretty crazy\".\nIn his interview with me, Mr Pichai was more circumspect, saying that social media companies needed to do more to promote accurate stories.\n\"This is very important to us,\" he said.\n\"At Google we have always cared about bringing the most relevant, the most accurate results to users and that is where almost all of our work goes at the end of the day.\n\"It is important to remember that we get billions of queries every day.\n\"There have been a couple of incidences where it has been pointed out and we didn't get it right.\n\"And so it is a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it.\n\"Just in the last two days we announced that we will remove advertising from anything we identify as fake-news.\n\"Over the last year we have looked at things like how do we fact check articles, the notion of trusted sources in journalism - how do we promote those better.\n\"So there are a lot of initiatives we are undertaking so hopefully all of that will help us do it even better.\"\nI asked Mr Pichai whether he believed fake news could have affected the outcome of the election.\n\"I think there is a lot of discussion about this in the context of social media.\n\"I am not fully sure.\n\"Look, it is important to remember this was a very close election and so, just for me, so looking at it scientifically, one in a hundred voters voting one way or the other swings the election either way.\n\"So, when you talk about such narrow margins, obviously there are many, many contributing factors and so I think there is enormous debate because of that - I am not fully sure what caused this.\"\nGiven those tight margins, I asked, could fake news have affected some people's vote - and maybe enough people's vote to affect the outcome.\n\"Sure,\" he answered after a pause.\n\"You know, I think fake news as a whole could be an issue.\n\"From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here.\n\"So, I don't think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely.\"\nMr Pichai said it was too early to say whether Google would change its corporate tax structure if Mr Trump followed through with his campaign pledge to cut American business taxes.\nWith business tax rates currently above 30%, many global companies like Google shelter a substantial proportion of the profits they make in offshore tax jurisdictions.\n\"We have always said that the US corporate tax structure is part of the problem in the overall corporate structure globally for multi-nationals,\" Mr Pichai said.\n\"To the extent that there is progress there I think it will help us arrive at a better construct but the solution needs to be comprehensive and needs to work for all companies involved.\"\nI asked the Google chief executive about the controversies the company has faced over the payment of taxes and over accusations it has used its market dominance to crush opposition businesses.\n\"As a company, we want to be a good citizen in every market we are in and that is true for the UK as well,\" he said.\n\"To your question on tax - today, we contribute a lot to the UK economy and we enable for example small businesses to be the engine of any economy.\n\"We are happy to pay our fair share of tax.\n\"As you know tax is a global construct. We are a multi-national company in well over 100 countries and we have advocated comprehensive tax reform so we can engage and get to a better place.\n\"But I think it is important to remember that we are one company in a global system and it is more important for governments and citizens to sort out the right structure and we are always happy to engage in a thoughtful and constructive manner.\"\nOn criticisms from competitors and in Brussels that Google has acted anti-competitively, Mr Pichai said \"there has never been a day at Google where we have had a construct like that\".\nHe said the company developed technology that was shareable and focused on what consumers wanted.","summary":"Google is to open a new headquarters building in London which could see 3,000 new jobs created by 2020.","id":37988095}
{"document":"You might forgive Laura Trott and Jason Kenny for leaving Rio rather full of themselves. Five competitions between them, five golds won. As of Tuesday night, had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table, above Jamaica, Kenya and Brazil.\nThat would be to misunderstand what makes them tick. This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders.\nYou might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire. Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games, more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Trott has four, more than any other British woman, and from one fewer Olympics.\nThat would be to misjudge their relationship. Cycling superstars on their own, together they can be almost ordinary, almost invisible. After the gold rush, after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on, that may be about to change.\n\"The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them,\" says Trott's father Adrian.\n\"Until he gets to know you, Jason is a little bit shy. He's quiet and understated. Laura is bubbly, chatty, just as you see in her interviews.\n\"If they were both like Jason, God only knows how they'd talk about anything. And God forbid having two Lauras in a household!\"\nThe relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012, with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy's muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first.\n\"I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago,\" says Kenny's mother Lorraine.\n\"I said to my husband, 'Flipping heck, you need to watch this young lady.' She was in the elimination race, only a tiny thing, and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone. She was amazing.\n\"The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said, 'I'm bringing Trotty home for a bacon butty.'\n\"I said to him, 'Is she your girlfriend?' 'No, she's just a friend.'\n\"She made herself at home straight away. Into the house, sat down, feet up on the sofa.\n\"We liked her from the off. She's a girly girl, so I can talk make-up and clothes to her. It's such a treat - having had two sons, I've had years of remote-control cars and standing out in the rain, and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes.\"\nTrott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds.\nSome (Steffi Graf, ladies' singles 1988, Andre Agassi, men's singles 1996) have carried more global renown. Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games, most recently triathletes Jan Frodeno and Emma Snowsill at Beijing in 2008. But no-one at a summer Games has more. No-one else gets even close.\nNeither has the British duo finished. Trott is 24, Kenny 28. The next Olympics in Tokyo are in their sights.\n\"When I first met Laura, what stuck in my mind was how she was on what she wanted to achieve,\" says her agent Luke Lloyd Davies.\n\"She said to me, 'I want to be the most decorated British Olympian of all time'. I remember thinking, for a 21-year-old to have that determination is remarkable.\n\"She reminds me of [former England rugby union player] Jonny Wilkinson - that same dedication, the way nothing will faze her in competition. Off the bike she is a really sweet 20-something. She likes getting dressed up, she dreams of Mulberry bags and Prada shoes. But when her peers are out partying, she is burying herself in training.\"\nAnd there is nothing glamorous about the sessions each put in at the velodrome at Manchester's Sportcity each day. Lap after 250m lap, staring at the black line and scuffed boards, round and round, lactic in the legs, fire in the lungs.\n\"It hurts so badly,\" Trott once told me. \"It's like your legs are getting squeezed. You try to fight against it, but it's horrible, and they're just getting tighter and tighter. You're going slower and slower.\"\nNothing has come easy. Born six weeks premature with a collapsed lung, Trott spent the first weeks of her life in intensive care. As a child she suffered serious asthma; at the exact moment she first sat on a bike, aged four, her big sister Emma - who would go on to race professionally for the Dutch team Dolmans-Boels - was crashing and breaking her leg at the bottom of the same hill.\nAs a young girl she preferred trampolining to her bike, only to be forced to give it up after repeatedly passing out in mid-air. \"I kept getting dehydrated during sessions, because you had to go out of the room to get a drink, and I was like, 'Nah, I'll carry on bouncing'.\"\nThat's the heroic stuff. Not everything she does ends in such glorious success,\n\"Laura is the sort of person who can ruin a baked potato in a microwave,\" says Adrian.\n\"We've always cooked with gas at home, but when she first moved into the British Cycling academy flats in Manchester, they had electricity instead. She put a potato in the oven to bake and thought she'd turned the gas on - except she'd put the grill on instead. Pretty soon it was on fire. She smoked the whole flat out.\"\nSo it is that Kenny tends to be entrusted with kitchen duties.\n\"He is a very good cook,\" says Lorraine. \"He now does a brilliant Sunday roast, although he never used to cook when he lived at home. He says Laura is the bad influence, that she's the one who buys the chocolate.\n\"He gets his sporting genes from me. I used to run 100m and 200m. His dad Michael is very self-disciplined, and Jason has inherited that from him.\n\"Unlike me, he copes well under pressure. I have to force myself to watch him in big finals. I used to put my hands over my eyes, but then he lost a race when I was doing that so I've had to go back to actually looking.\n\"When they were younger, we took both our boys to different sports - they were lively lads, so we were trying to keep them out of mischief. We were just an ordinary family, and he was an ordinary boy doing ordinary things.\n\"He's not changed at all. He's just Jason. His elder brother Craig is the chatterbox, so maybe Jason thought he never needed to talk. But he has a fantastic sense of humour. It's so dry I think sometimes people don't get it.\"\nFind out how to get into cycling with our special guide.\nWhen they return to the UK, Trott and Kenny will wind down by walking their two dogs, springer-poodle crosses named Pringle and Sprolo. In September they will get married. Already they have turned down an offer to have it featured in a magazine.\nFame has never been the driving force. Kenny may have 54,000 followers on Twitter, but he last tweeted in early July. Trott may have won more Olympic gold medals than any other British woman, but the motivation remains pure.\n\"It isn't a job to me, but if it did feel like one, it would be a dream job,\" she says. \"All I do is ride my bike for four hours a day and then lie on the sofa for the rest of it. I don't feel like I'd ever fall out of love with it.\"\nAnd each understands exactly what the other is going through. How could they not, when together they have turned a cottage in Cheshire into a medal factory?\n\"If I was in a relationship with someone outside cycling,\" says Trott, \"just imagine how hard it would be.

Famed for his ability to swerve his body and produce a goal from nothing, Curtis was a fearsome striker, capped 35 times by his country while playing for Leeds United and Southampton.\nSuch is the admiration Swansea fans have for Curtis, even a spell at arch rivals Cardiff City has not affected his legendary status at The Liberty.\nHaving spent a lifetime in the game, it is easy to make the case that for Curtis football was always in the blood.\nHis uncle was Roy Paul, who captained Manchester City to FA Cup success in 1956 against Birmingham City in a contest synonymous with City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who played on despite suffering a broken neck. Paul, too, was a Wales international, earning 33 caps.\nBorn and raised in the Rhondda Valley, Curtis admits his entire adult life has been connected to the club he loves.\n\"Football has always been the passion, but Swansea has been my life since 17 or 18,\" he said.\nOther than a 12-month hiatus at Leeds, Curtis was an integral member of the great Swans team shaped by John Toshack in the late 1970s and early 80s - the side the future Wales and Real Madrid boss took from the fourth division to the top six of the top tier inside five years.\nOn the two occasion Swansea have risen from English football's fourth tier to the top, Curtis has played a pivotal role.\nCurtis was part of the coaching staff when Swansea were a game away from dropping out of the Football League in 2003.\nHe was not being paid at one stage as the club entered administration - but never complained.\nCurtis remained in the backroom staff as they powered their way through the divisions again to the Premier League in 2011, before winning the 2013 League Cup and qualifying for the Europa League.\nEven the staff profile on Swansea's official website describes Curtis as a \"legend\" but he believes that has more to do with hyperbole than his 40-year association with the club.\n\"I think people become legends these days. All you need to do is be at a club for a season and you automatically become one,\" he told BBC Wales Sport.\n\"People like Robbie James, Jeremy Charles, Ivor Allchurch and Herbie Williams - those are the people you consider to be the real [Swansea] legends.\"\nHe is Curt by name, courteous by nature.

I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here.\n\"I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'.\"\nThe street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women.\nHe says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff.\n\"There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying.\"\nMr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about.\n\"The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time.\"\nHis memories of the street in its heyday are of \"watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\".\n\"Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\"\nMr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of \"certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then\".\nFollowing their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs.\nRobin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail.\n\"At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" he says.\n\"The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\"\nLiz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there.\n\"Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street.\n\"But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street.\n\"When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one.\n\"Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm.\n\"The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street.\n\"At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool.\n\"I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him.\n\"He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?'

To which he replied 'Oh, good.'\"\nBut, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble.\nMedia tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions.\nBy 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards.\nAs a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the \"Stab in the Back\" is a Pizza Express.\nNow a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline.\n\"As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,\" says Mr Smith.\n\"It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.\"","summary":"The last two journalists working in Fleet Street are leaving what was once seen as the centre of UK journalism.","id":36882573}

{"document":"Have the media lost interest? Is it a question of chronic political fatigue? Are our brains simply not wired to think long-term?\nThe BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses.\nMax Boykoff founded the Media Climate Change Observatory a decade ago.\n\"We monitor 50 sources around the world across 25 countries on six continents. We seek to put our fingers on the pulse of the ebbs and flows of coverage of climate change over time, month to month.\n\"It's not an exhaustive reading of all media accounts everywhere around the globe across all platforms, but rather is a way to get us talking productively.\n\"In 2004 there were relatively low levels of coverage. Around 2006, into 2007 there was an uptick. There was a high water mark in 2009 [at the time of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen].\n\"From that high water mark to 2014, coverage has dropped: 36% globally; 26% in the US; and as much as 55% in the UK.\n\"Within the last year here in the United States, National Public Radio reduced its environment reporting team from three to one reporter.\n\"We see examples of this unfolding quite regularly. There's certainly newsroom pressures. There's shrinking time to deadline, there's reduced resources to cover complex issues such as climate change that require a certain level of investigation, a certain level of familiarity with the contours and the nuances of the topics.\"\nJennifer Morgan is the Global Director of the climate change programme at the World Resources Institute.\n\"Copenhagen was supposed to be the moment when over 190 countries came together and agreed a new legally binding agreement to address climate change. It was very much a great excitement and anticipation of trying to finally get a global agreement after the Kyoto years.\n\"I remember walking in with a colleague of mine, and saying 'Okay, we have to do it.  We have to get this done, these moments don't happen very often'.\n\"But it soon became clear that negotiations weren't going to plan:\n\"In the middle of the second week normally what happens is the options start to get narrowed down, and you can see the package emerging. That wasn't happening, and that's when we all started to get very concerned.\"\nChina's chief negotiator was barred by security for the first few days, sessions were routinely suspended in the name of finishing on time, developing countries said they were ignored, and the EU was missing from a final meeting where a last-minute, non-binding deal was drawn up.\n\"It was terrible. [We felt] an exhausted defeat, just a deep fatigue, particularly from the European side, of just wanting to take a break. The personal sacrifice - it sounds crazy - but believing and trying to make something happen, I think it was a trauma, just to put so much blood, sweat and tears into it.\n\"Right after Copenhagen, there was a sense that there needed to be a bit of a time out on the world leaders' side of things. So it definitely went into a very low level of attention for a few years. The relationships of some of the Heads of State after Copenhagen were quite strained.\n\"Even months after, it was almost like [they] had been being psychologically burned by this.\n\"That's had a real impact on the willingness of these individuals to stay engaged.\"\nEnvironmental psychologist Robert Gifford researches why even those who accept a link between human behaviour and climate change are reluctant to act.\n\"Our brain physically hasn't developed much for about 30,000 years. At that time we were mostly wandering around on the Savannah, and our main concerns were very immediate: feeding ourselves right now, worrying about anybody who might try to take our territory. There was very little thinking about what might happen in five years, 10 years, or 100km away.\n\"We still have this same brain. Obviously we're capable of planning, but the kind of default is to stick into the here and now, which is not very good for thinking about climate change, which is a problem that, for many people, is more in the future and farther away, or at least we think it is.\n\"[And] as any advertiser knows, if you don't change your message people will just tune out. And so environmental numbness is 'yes, I've heard that message before'. We're always open to new messages, and paying more attention to new messages. So if governments or policymakers repeat the same message too often, people just tune out after a while.\"\nWe also tend to tune out when we feel helpless:\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT\nListen to the programme\nDownload the programme\n\"'What can I do about this global problem? I'm just one person, and there's 7+ billion people on the planet. I just don't have much control over this, so therefore I'm not going to do much about it, because my contribution, even if I did everything, wouldn't make much difference.'\n\"Most of us who are trying to do something about this have realised, for example, that the polar bear metaphor is not a great one. Yes, we have some sympathy for this poor polar bear, but it's not close enough to our own lives.\n\"Uncertainty is a really big problem. We've learned in my own laboratory from experimental evidence that when people feel a bit uncertain about an environmental problem - if the future temperature might vary from a half a degree increase to a one and a half degrees increase - people will say 'well, it's probably only going to be a half a degree increase, so I'll keep flying to some tropical place'.\n\"It's a natural human tendency to interpret information in a way that suits our personal interests.\nJoe Smith teaches geography at the Open University and argues the narrative around climate science must evolve.\n\"I'm not sure that people need to engage with climate change at all. It's more or less unreportable if you just describe it on the page.  It's complex, interdisciplinary, the findings drip out over time, and the boundary between science and policy and politics is a very messy one. It's a real challenge for the media.\n\"The idea that we will mobilise any more people with fear messaging is wrong.  I think we've knocked at the door of everyone that might respond to such a thing, but you've also got to ask whether it's an accurate way of telling the science.  I think it is more respectful to the nature of the science to say that it's one of humanity's most ambitious questions.\n\"There was a tactical wrong turning in suggesting that by insisting that the debate is over, we can move onto the action. It somehow implied that the science was complete, and that, of course, left lots of space for those people who have arguments about the actions on climate change to stand in the way of us having a proper public conversation about those actions because they were able to pick apart minor details in the science.\n\"It's not just that climate science isn't finished, it's actually unfinishable.\n\"The rest of science - particle physics, cosmology - is allowed to be rather saucy. I would love to get to the point where we allow climate change science to simply be interesting, enchanting even, as fascinating as any area of science because it's a hugely ambitious and compelling mission.\n\"If you want to talk to a business person, you talk about energy security for their business or energy security for their nation.  If you want to talk to a parent at the school gate, you talk to them about the health of their child, their experience of the trip to school - wouldn't they be happier walking and cycling?\n\"Talking about climate change doesn't have to involve 'talking about climate change' to lead us to some really substantial actions.\n\"We don't need to wear a climate change t-shirt.\"\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT.

These details will unlock new information about the structure, origin and evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy.\nAnd because Gaia will track anything that passes across its field of vision, it is likely also to see countless objects that had hitherto gone unrecorded - such as asteroids, planets beyond our Solar System, and tepid stars that never quite fired into life.\nWhat you see in the image at the top of this page is Gaia's electrical and service module.\nThis is the part of the satellite that will do all of the \"housekeeping\" in space. It contains elements such as the attitude and orbit control system, the avionics, the computer and data handling subsystems. A large antenna will go underneath the structure to allow Gaia to talk to Earth.\nWhat you do not see here is the payload module that will eventually go on top.  This will be the unit that contains Gaia's telescopes and camera system.\nNor do you see the thermal shield which will open - petal-like - from the underside of the service module to give protection to Gaia's sensitive optics.\n\"Gaia came to Stevenage about a year ago as a bare structure,\" said the Astrium UK Gaia project manager, Andy Whitehouse.\n\"Since then we've integrated the propulsion system.  We've built all of that offline and then put it on the structure.  There's a lot of pipework that runs around inside, and the tanks are also inside as well.\"\nMark Tomlin, the assembly and integration test manager, added: \"There wasn't much time to bring all this together.  We've done almost 500 welds on the mechanical service module and that's taken us on the order of six months to achieve.  It's been a monumental task.  Each weld has to be X-rayed and cleaned.\"\nAs a lead member state of the European Space Agency, the UK is playing a prominent role on the mission, both scientifically and industrially.\nThe immense array of camera detectors, or CCDs (charge-coupled devices), is being provided by e2v at Chelmsford.\n\"The bulk of the work going on here at Astrium UK is on the electrical side, not the mechanical side,\" observed Dr Ralph Cordey, the company's head of science.\n\"This includes the crucial onboard processing units, which turn the prodigious amounts of data Gaia will get from its CCDs into a data stream that can be sent to Earth.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk","summary":"It should be one of the great space ventures of the decade.","id":10693692}

Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead.\n\"Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops.

A move which angered the double world champion.\nAlonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6.\nIt led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag.\nThe Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint.\nMeanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place.\nVettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier.\nVettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position.\nButton was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres.\nRather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap.\nVettel said: \"The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.\n\"I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.\"\nButton said: \"It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end.\n\"When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push.\n\"It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.\n\"But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again.

Only Liam Foster-Jones, of the three unemployed friends, seems certain about who the imperious features and swept-back helmet of hair might belong to.\n\"It's Margaret Thatcher,\" he says.\nThe name doesn't seem to mean much to them.\nIt would have been a different story 36 years ago, when the Thatcher government closed Consett's steel works, with the loss of 3,700 jobs.\nThe devastation inflicted on this remote town high on the edge of the Pennines, where unemployment soared to 36%, made the national news and became a symbol of the harsh medicine the Thatcher government thought it had to administer to Britain's heavy industries.\nIt sowed the seeds for the electoral wipe out the Conservatives would experience across large parts of Northern England and Scotland, which it still trying to recover from today.\nThatcher and \"the Tories\" remain dirty words to the former steel workers in Consett but few young people I spoke to could recognise her and those that did regarded her as a distant historical figure.\n\"I don't really have an opinion [about her] but my dad doesn't like her because she shut down the steel works,\" said 20-year-old Adam Stokoe.\n\"So my dad has strong opinions about that. I'm not from that time period so I don't really think about it that way. I only think about now. What's going to benefit me.\"\nConsett has never had a Conservative MP but the Tory vote held up surprisingly well in other parts of the North-East while Thatcher was in power. In 1983, the party took 34% of North East votes, and had five MPs.\nIt was only after she left office that anti-Tory attitudes really hardened, with the party's share of the vote slumping by 10%. It currently has just three MPs in the region.\nTheresa May is attempting to change that on 8 June and has urged traditional Labour supporters to \"lend\" her their vote.\nShe will have experienced at first hand how difficult it is to break the voting habits of a lifetime in this part of the world when she stood for election in North West Durham in 1992.\n(By a strange coincidence, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was also standing for Parliament for the first time that year in the same constituency.)\nThey still remember Mrs May at Consett Working Men's Club - because, claims the barman, they wouldn't let her through the door.\nIt had nothing to do with her politics, he adds, it's just that the club is one of a tiny handful left in the UK that does not admit women.\n\"Your wife can't chase you in here,\" says one regular, looking up from his racing form. He doesn't want to talk about politics.\nMrs May won 28% of the vote in North West Durham - a score that has not been beaten by a Conservative candidate there since - but although one local poll put the party in with a chance of winning on 8 June it is not high on their target list.\nThere was certainly little enthusiasm for Mrs May's brand of Conservatism in the town's Steel Club, although the lifelong Labour voters I spoke to were equally scathing about their traditional party of choice.\n\"I don't like Jeremy Corbyn. He hasn't got a brain in his head as far as I'm concerned,\" said Christopher Bell, a 69-year-old retired steel worker and club steward.\nHe and his partner, Linda, voted for Brexit in last year's referendum and are worried about the strain they say is being placed on local services by East European immigrants.\nLinda, who voted UKIP in 2015, said she would not return to the Labour fold until the party was led by \"somebody that's going to stand up for English people, working class people - because the Conservatives like the rich and they like to keep them rich\".\nThirty miles south in Darlington, a constituency with a narrower Labour majority of just over 3,000, people seemed more receptive to the Conservative message.\nThe town has had a Tory MP before - Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in the 1980s - and the party has hopes of retaking the seat on 8 June.\n\"I will vote for Theresa May. Not necessarily because she's a Conservative but I think she's the only person for the job. Given the other options,\" says Alex Blackham, owner of a cafe in the town's indoor market.\n\"If she'd been Labour or an independent then I would have been voting for her as a person. I think that's what politics comes down to sometimes.\"\nClive Hinson, a 59-year-old assembly line worker who was about to tuck into one of Mr Blackham's full English breakfasts, blames Thatcher for the closure of the dump truck factory he worked at in the 1980s.\nBut he adds: \"Funnily enough, I'll be voting Conservative. Because I think Corbyn is a waste of time.\n\"He can't give a definitive answer on defence. He's got all these plans for spending loads of money but the figures just don't add up....so much though I don't want to vote Conservative that's the way I'm voting.\"\nHe says the North East has \"forgiven but not forgotten\" Thatcher, comparing the reconciliation process to what happened in Northern Ireland or South Africa. Like Mr Blackham he voted for Brexit in last year's EU referendum.\nMost of the older working class people I spoke to - the traditional bedrock of Labour support in the area - needed no prompting to criticise what they saw as Jeremy Corbyn's lack of leadership ability and charisma.\nHe seemed to go over much better with younger, more cosmopolitan voters.\n\"I would vote Corbyn all day every day,\" said Stephen Lock, who runs a comic book stall in the covered market with wife June.\n\"He's such a man of the people by the looks of it. He's looking after the general working people. He seems to have great ideas. They may be a little outdated in the modern day, but he's not the person they're painting him out to be. They are trying to make him out to be weak and I don't think he is.\"\nThe couple returned from 13 years in France, where they had a gardening business, after the Brexit vote. \"We thought we had better come back and do something else here. It's affected us quite heavily,\" said Stephen.\nThey are torn between voting Labour and Liberal Democrats - and are not impressed by what they see as the disloyalty of Labour MPs who openly criticise their leader.\n\"The Labour Party is shooting itself in the foot by not acting and standing as one,\" said June.\n\"You have got career politicians that are more concerned about their own personal interests than their constituents.\"\nThere also appeared to real enthusiasm for Corbyn among Darlington's student population, who blame the media for portraying him in a negative light.\n\"You don't see a lot of coverage of, like, nice things about him,\" said 18-year-old Emily Frewin. \"But when you actually read into it he is a nice person.\"\nTheresa May avoids talking to the voters, she adds, but \"he seems like he wants to talk to everybody, not just the rich people\".\n\"He does seem to be getting slandered quite a lot,\" agrees 20-year-old software development student Josh Walker, \"when he's trying to fight for us.\"\nIf the Thatcher factor was ever a major impediment to a Tory revival in the North East, it has undoubtedly faded with time.\nThe party's tactic of detaching Theresa May's name - it was emblazoned across the battle bus she toured the North-East in - from the Conservative brand appears to be working with some voters, who might feel a little queasy at the prospect of putting their cross next to a Tory candidate.\nSome told me they had flirted with a Conservative vote, only to think better of it - Mrs May's support for a free vote on fox hunting, not an issue that has exactly dominated the airwaves, was mentioned by several people as a reason for not switching to the Tories.\nAnd there will always be some who will never forget, or forgive. Like the Darlington woman who greeted Theresa May's name with a horrified cry of \"she's another Maggie Thatcher!\".\nBut on the basis of this highly unscientific sample, Thatcher is no longer the bogey figure she was and Labour can no longer rely on the loyalty of its traditional support base.","summary":"The Conservatives are hoping to win back seats in the North-East of England on 8 June - has the party finally escaped the shadow of Margaret Thatcher which helped make much of the region a no-go area for them?","id":39949130}

It has though supplied its Syrian counterpart with the aircraft in the past.\nSome - at least - of Syria's Mig-29s are still operational; indeed, as a fighter rather than a ground attack aircraft, they have flown a lot less during Syria's protracted civil war.\nSyria and Turkey have a difficult history of incidents over recent years. In 2012, Syrian missiles shot down a Turkish Phantom jet off the Mediterranean coast.\nLast year, Turkish jets shot down a Syrian Mig-23 that had strayed into Turkish airspace along with a Syrian helicopter earlier this year.

All 43 forces in England and Wales responded in the latest study.\nThe NSPCC said the total had largely remained steady until this year's figures, and that the 38% rise was the biggest increase in six years of requesting the data.\nThe number has now increased by almost 50% since 2008\/09.\nIn Scotland, government figures showed that in 2013-14 there were 3,742 sexual offences against children under 18 recorded, including rape, sexual assault and grooming - a 10-year high.\nThe NSPCC said 1,485 sexual offences against people under 18 were reported to police in Northern Ireland in 2013\/14, up 26% on the previous year.\nBy Mark Easton, BBC home editor\nThe fact that police are recording more suspected incidents of child sexual abuse should probably be regarded as a positive development.\nPolice forces have put significant effort into encouraging victims of such crimes to come forward and this seems to be paying off. Prosecutors and chief constables are under instruction to take seriously allegations that are made and, where appropriate, revisit reports made in the past.\nBritain is only beginning to recognise the appalling scale of child abuse and the criminal justice system still only deals with a fraction of offences. It is possible - indeed the recent focus on child welfare and big falls in overall violent crime makes it probable in my view - that sexual offences against children are falling, despite all the horrific cases that have come to light in the last few years.\nHowever, while more victims coming forward is good news, it is vital that the resources and support are available to deal with the increased demands on police and other services.\nThe NSPCC's Mr Brown said there was not enough support available for children who had been sexually abused.\n\"Their concerns need to be taken seriously and acted promptly upon.\n\"Through the court process they need to be supported and there are some real gaps there, and then there's a huge gap in the amount of help and therapy that's available for children who have been abused.\"\nMr Brown said the charity estimated that there was a shortfall of 50,000 places across the UK for children who needed treatment, having been sexually abused.\nThe figures are published as the NSPCC launches its third annual \"How Safe Are Our Children?\" report at the charity's annual conference in London.\nA government spokeswoman said children must be protected from \"systemic and appalling cases\" of abuse such as those seen in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford and elsewhere.\nShe said: \"We have given child sexual abuse the status of a national threat so that it is prioritised by every police force, will shortly launch a new child sexual abuse taskforce and centre of expertise to improve local responses and we have provided \u00c2\u00a37m funding to organisations that support victims.\n\"It is encouraging that police figures show more victims are having the confidence to come forward and report these often ignored and under-reported crimes.\"\nHome Secretary Theresa May has established an independent inquiry to probe allegations of historical child sex abuse and a Westminster paedophile ring.\nBy Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent\nOver the past 18 months there's been a raft of data indicating that more people are reporting sexual offences.\nWhat's different about these statistics is that there's a breakdown by age of victim, enabling us to see the extent of the problem as it affects children. It's a deeply worrying picture.\nIt raises questions about the level of support available for victims, at a time when criminal justice, welfare and health budgets are under strain, as well as the need to find ways to deal effectively with the perpetrators.\nTo do that we must attempt to understand what drives people to commit offences against children and babies, however unpalatable that may be, to prevent further crimes in the future.\nLast month it emerged that police were investigating more than 1,400 prominent men for historic child sex abuse, including politicians, celebrities and those linked to institutions.\nAnd also last month, the NPCC said it had seen an \"unprecedented increase\" in the number of reports of abuse following the Savile cases coming to light.\nMr Bailey said of the latest figures:  \"The service now looks upon child abuse very differently and victims can expect a professional response.\n\"As a result many, many, more victims have found the confidence to report abuse, knowing they will be treated with sensitivity and respect, that we will listen to them and that we will take their allegations seriously.\"","summary":"The number of recorded sexual offences against children in England and Wales has risen by a third, the NSPCC says.","id":33160361}

enter State House.\nAmong other things he wants a total overhaul of the electoral commission and direct appointment of the commissioners.\nHe believes the body as currently constituted is not credible and cannot oversee a credible electoral process in 2017.\nHe does not want reforms through a parliamentary process.\nHe knows very well the current government has enough numbers in the house to frustrate his efforts.\nHe is the MP for Gatundu South, a constituency in central Kenya that has produced two presidents - Jomo Kenyatta and Uhuru Kenyatta.\nHe is Kenya's Donald Trump (minus the billions and the presidential ambition): Straight-talking, unpredictable and uncontrollable.\nHe wants the opposition to tremble in their boots as they prepare for dialogue.\nFor the umpteenth time Mr Kuria is in trouble and facing serious charges of hate speech.\nMany Kenyans view him as the government's kamikaze - a force of self-destruction that also conveniently distracts attention from the ruling establishment.\nHe is the senator for Machakos County and a prominent opposition voice.\nHe is wealthy, loud and bold.\nHe will say the unsayable and often makes the government quite uncomfortable.\nMr Muthama is one of the eight legislators who were arrested for hate speech.\nHe is the chairman and face of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).\nHe does not want to go home - at least not yet.\nHe wants both government and the opposition to leave him and his team alone to continue preparing for next year's election, arguing that a change of guard now will have a negative impact on the 2017 elections.\nIt is a non-lethal chemical weapon that irritates the eyes, mouth, lungs and skin.\nIn Kenya, it is personified by the cabinet secretary in charge of internal security, Joseph Nkaissery.\nThe former military man talks and acts tough.\nIn mid-May he cautioned opposition protesters: \"Let them be warned that I have enough tear gas - which I will not run short of soon - to use in smoking them out of IEBC offices if they attempt to force themselves there.\"\nThroughout Kenya's history, in the absence of talks to resolve political disputes, tear gas talks.\nI have personal experience of this having inhaled enough tear gas as a student and journalist - from being caught up in the streets of Nairobi during a violent military operation to suppress an attempted air force coup against President Daniel arap Moi in August 1982 to reporting the countrywide demonstrations demanding an end to single party authoritarian rule in July 1990.\nThis is a Swahili term meaning the ordinary citizen of Kenya.\nEvery political blow unleashed, every tear gas canister fired and every word uttered is done in his\/her name.\nBut the mwananchi is not present at the ongoing talks to reform that key institution that will referee the election and shape the future.\nMany wananchi (Swahili plural for citizens) noted two striking photographs that remind them of their true place.\nOne was an image from 2008 that showed then-President Mwai Kibaki, Mr Odinga and Mr Annan sharing soft drinks in a relaxed atmosphere soon after the country went ablaze with Kenyans fighting the two rivals' battles.\nThe second photo was of a recent event and showed President Uhuru and Mr Odinga in a jovial moment at State House, while out in the streets life was disrupted as clashes between security forces and protesters ensued on behalf of the two men.\nBut it is this same mwananchi who will be called upon to decide which man goes into rent-free accommodation at State House in next year's election.\nIf mwananchi makes the wrong choice, the soil of Kenya will drink his blood and the mass grave will quickly fill up.\nMore from Joseph Warungu:","summary":"In our series of letters from Africa, journalist and media trainer Joseph Warungu takes advantage of the temporary lull in tear gas to examine the rocky political climate in Kenya.","id":36602399}
{"document":"Clinical trials are the key to getting that data - and without volunteers to take part in the trials, there would be no new treatments for serious diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and arthritis.\nBut one disastrous drug trial at a London hospital in 2006 threatened to derail that system.\nIn what became known as the Elephant Man trial, six healthy young men were treated for organ failure after experiencing a serious reaction within hours of taking the drug TGN1412 in a clinical trial.\nBig rise in medical trial volunteers\nAfter they were all admitted to intensive care, two became critically ill, the worst affected lost his fingers and toes, and all the men were subsequently told they would be likely to develop cancers or auto-immune diseases as a result of their exposure to the drug.\nIn follow-up interviews, the men described feeling like their brains were \"on fire\" and their \"eyeballs were going to pop out\".\nExperts queued up to say the outcome of the trial had been unprecedented and exceptional, but could it happen again?\nProf David Webb, professor of therapeutics and clinical pharmacology at the University of Edinburgh and vice president of the British Pharmacological Society, says it is \"much less likely to happen again\".\nHe says things have changed for the better since 2006, following a number of recommendations made in the Duff Report, written in response to the trial.\n\"The MHRA [Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency] now ensures committees look at pre-clinical data, to decide whether the first dose given to humans is the right dose and has rules for stopping if things don't go as expected.\"\nBefore a drug is tested on humans, it goes through laboratory and animal testing.  Medicines are also tested for toxicity before being given to people.\nThen there are four stages of drug testing in humans.\nPhase I - studies, on a small number of healthy volunteers, to understand what effects a new medicine has on human subjects - what happens to the compound in the body from the time it is swallowed or injected until it is excreted. Study participants are monitored for side effects.\nPhase II - designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a drug in patients who are at the same stage of a specific disease or condition. They are given various doses of a compound and closely monitored.\nPhase III - used to confirm a new drug's safety and efficacy, while working out the best dosage regimen. Studies are carried out in large numbers of patients with a specific disease or condition. Safety and efficacy is compared to the currently accepted standard treatment.\nPhase IV - these studies take place after the drug has been approved for marketing. They evaluate the long-term effects of the drug in larger numbers of patients, sub-populations of patients. Less common adverse events may be detected.\nMHRA\nThis is particularly important when trials involve drugs that affect the immune system, he says.\nBut is it possible to eliminate the risks entirely?\n\"You can mitigate against the risks, but nothing is 100% certain. We can never be sure,\" Prof Webb says.\nThe trial, which was privately run at a research facility at Northwick Park Hospital in north London, involved the first testing of a new drug on humans. This is the initial phase in assessing the safety of a drug before moving onto larger-scales studies in patients themselves.\nThe report said Parexel, the company managing the trial, had been unclear about a safe dose to start testing on humans and it should have tested the drug on one person at a time.\nThe MHRA, which regulates clinical trials and medicines in the UK, and which was criticised at the time for giving the green light to the TGN1412 trial, says the conduct on these phase-one trials \"has moved on significantly\".\n\"Additional provisions and guidance has been put in place for certain novel products to provide as much assurance on safety as possible,\" the agency says.\nIt adds that it has simplified and streamlined the regulation of clinical trials and collaborated with other bodies and experts to collect as much information as possible on risk factors before a trial is authorised.\nPhase-one trials, when drugs are tested on humans for the first time, only happen after extensive testing on tissue samples and animals in the lab.\nGetting this stage right before moving onto research in humans is crucial.\nDr Catherine Elliott, director of clinical research interests at the Medical Research Council, which funds clinical trials in the UK and globally, says there is a move to refine the models used at the pre-clinical stage.\n\"Animal models are the mainstay, but we are trying to develop other models too to have more tailored disease models.\"\nShe says researchers are making use of brain imaging to understand the mechanisms of illness in humans and using IT to predict the effects of new drugs.\nTesting on animals, which has its own controversies, can get scientists so far - but someone always has to be the first person to test a new medicine.\nThe volunteers for phase-one clinical tests always have to be healthy young men because of the risk to a woman's eggs or foetus.\nProf Webb says we are indebted to the 50 to 100 people in the UK each year who step forward to begin the testing of every new drug.\n\"There are so many effective medicines for cancer, heart disease et cetera - and they all come from volunteers who have taken part in small, early studies.\"\nHe believes that everyone who wants to should be able to register themselves available for clinical research through their GP.\n\"I would argue that everyone should be a volunteer. We'd get the payback eventually because by the time we're in our 60s and 70s most of us will end up on medicines.\"\nAlthough volunteers are compensated for their time and inconvenience during the trial, they are not paid for taking part - and Dr Elliott says this is the correct approach.\n\"There shouldn't be an incentive to do something they wouldn't otherwise do. It shouldn't be related to risk. People have to be able to give free consent.\"\nDespite all this, there appears to have been no reduction in interest in participating in early-stage trials since Northwick Park.\nThe MHRA says the number of UK clinical trial authorisation applications has been fairly stable at 900-1,000 per year since May 2004.\nProf Webb says he has always found it relatively easy to find volunteers for the \"first in man\" trials he oversees at his approved research centre in Edinburgh.\nThe MHRA is in no doubt about the safety of drug trials, seven years on from Northwick Park.\nA representative said: \"Clinical trials in the UK have an excellent safety record and they play a vital role in the development of new medicines, providing evidence so that clinicians can make informed prescribing decisions.\n\"Safety problems associated with clinical trials are rare and the risk of a repeat of the incident in 2006 concerning the TGN1412 drug is extremely low.\"","summary":"Before any new medicine can be given to patients, detailed information about how it works and how safe it is must be collected.","id":22556736}

The eight-time European number one rolling back the years to card a five-under-par 66.\nAs the Scot limbered, former BBC commentator David Begg, who was on marshalling duty, informed me that: \"Monty is putting beautifully.\" He added: \"Ten putts on the back nine.\"\nMore of the same and Monty would be a shoe-in for one last Open hurrah on his home course of Royal Troon, surely. After all, he ended his first round a shot off the lead and there are three qualifying places up for grabs.\nNo wonder Monty is, as one mature observer informs me, \"all sweetness and light\".\nWill it last?\nOnly one way to find out. To set out in the footsteps of Monty, or at least follow him round the course.\nThe former Ryder Cup captain is joined in game 10 by Sam Robinson, from Market Raisen, and John Henry, from Clydebank. But, apart from a coterie of family and friends of the two younger men, the punters are here to see if Monty can do it.\nThere must be at least 150 ready to follow the big man round.\n\"It doesn't get much better than this,\" a young golf enthusiast tells me. \"You can walk right behind him on the fairways, no ropes or anything like that, and the players even talk to you.\"\nThat said, there's a sort of 10-yard de facto exclusion zone around Monty as he stalks the fairways with loping strides. After all, you don't want to get too close, just in case.\nMonty starts well, finding the green with his second shot and leaving him a 12-foot putt for birdie. It's in! Today, it seems, he has the magic touch.\n\"He's in great form, chatting away,\" an elderly gent informs me before another observer, also of mature years, chips in: \"No he's not.\"\nYou couldn't say there's a lot of love in the air for Monty. More like deep admiration and respect for one of our greatest-ever golfers and, yes, a little fear.\n\"Stand still please,\" he rebukes a couple of golf fans who stray into his eyeline as he prepares to tee off. They freeze, mildly embarrassed, until the moment passes.\nAlas, Monty's second round is not the same sort of birdie fest as his morning session.\nThe putts just aren't dropping like they did before lunch, but he's fighting for every stroke. This means more to him he says than anyone else in the field - one last chance to qualify for an Open on his home course.\nMind you, if he misses out here, he will still get in with a top-four finish at the Scottish Open!\nMonty only manages one more birdie in his second round and a couple of bogeys, both at par threes, mean he finishes on level par.\nHowever, there are flashes of brilliance, particularly at the 15th, where he overcomes a horrible lie to save par. And there is none of the \"unravelling\" predicted by one doom monger.\nBy the time Monty gets to the 18th green, there are a couple of hundred spectators looking on. When he taps out for par, there is no ovation. His followers are too anxious for that.\n\"Will five under be enough? Is the young Swede still 10 under? What about the closing pack.\"\nYou see, judging by the demographic of my fellow travellers round 18 holes at Gailes, they don't want this journey to end.\nThey've been following Monty's triumphs and travails for years and, to a degree, shared in them - haven't we all.\nAs Monty lopes into the recorder's office, a small crowd gathers outside. Media men and onlookers.\nWhen he emerges, he signs autographs for a couple of young fans and speaks to reporters, telling them: \"I hope and pray I've done enough. We'll just have to wait and see.\"\nEnding with this promise: \"If I make it, I'll come back and talk to you.\"\nIndeed, he did make it, just, edging out compatriot Jack Doherty (not the television comic) by a stroke to finish third behind Oskar Arvidsson of Sweden and Scott Fernandez of Spain.","summary":"My day with Monty - and 200 other people - began with the words: \"Game number 10, on the tee from Royal Troon, Colin Montgomerie.\"","id":36658117}

{"document":"An emotional Canadian Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland left the talks in Brussels, saying the EU was \"not capable\" of signing a trade agreement.\nBelgium, the only country blocking accord, needed consent from the regional parliament of Wallonia.\nThe wide-ranging deal, seven years in the making, was to be signed next week.\nSpeaking outside the seat of the Walloon government, Ms Freeland told reporters:  \"It seems evident for me and for Canada that the European Union is not now capable of having an international accord even with a country that has values as European as Canada.\"\nShe added: \"Canada is disappointed, but I think it is impossible.\"\nIt was unclear whether the EU would keep negotiating with Wallonia in coming days to solve the impasse.\nEuropean Parliament briefing on Ceta\nThe Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta, was expected to boost bilateral trade, but Wallonia sees the accord as a threat to farmers and welfare standards.\nThe region has a strong socialist tradition. Its fears echo those of anti-globalisation activists, who say Ceta and deals like it give too much power to multinationals - power even to intimidate governments.\nThere have also been big demonstrations in several EU countries against Ceta and the TTIP trade talks with the US.\nThe Canada-EU trade deal was seven years in the making but it took far less time to unravel.\nCanada has been scrambling to keep Ceta together after the Walloon regional assembly in Belgium voted last week to reject it.\nThe deal was completed under Canada's former Conservative government but is a major priority for the Liberals, who are under pressure to boost the country's economy.\nThey dispatched special envoy Pierre Pettigrew, a former cabinet minister with a wealth of experience on the international trade file, to help save the flagging agreement.\nFederal trade minister Chrystia Freeland has met repeatedly over the past months with European leaders to shepherd it through, but with no luck.\nThe failure to clinch the EU-Canada Ceta deal is an embarrassment for the EU. Wallonia, a region of just 3.6 million people, has all but scuppered a trade deal affecting 508 million Europeans and 36.3 million Canadians.\nThe European Commission says this blow does not mean that Ceta is over, but it also refuses to unpick the massive text that was agreed with Canada in 2014.\nAny EU free trade deals with the US, China or India now look remote. Anti-globalisation groups, anxious to protect Europe's welfare and environmental standards, may feel they are winning the argument.\nFor now, any Ceta boost for small businesses and jobs has been postponed. The failure gives us a sense of how tough the Brexit talks will be, despite the UK's current alignment with its EU partners.\nOne very obvious lesson from this impasse is that it is going to be difficult for the European Union to implement trade and investment deals, perhaps with anyone.\nFor the UK post-Brexit it suggests two contrasting implications. Negotiating a trade agreement that gives British exporters barrier free access to the EU's single market could be a huge challenge.\nFor sure, there will be some important differences. For the EU, Britain is a more important export market than Canada, so some EU states will have a good deal to lose from failing to agree. But securing the agreement of all of them is unlikely to be straightforward.\nOn the other hand, negotiating an agreement with other countries outside the EU should become easier.

{"document":"But there certainly should be.\nThese are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\n\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\nBut if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\nThese are:\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\nWill customers benefit as well?","summary":"Since their impending merger was announced in January, there has been remarkably little comment about the huge proposed deal to combine Essilor and Luxottica.","id":38899892}

{"document":"Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, announced on Sunday that he would be backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU.\nHis intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with \"deafening eclat\" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely.\nHe has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on.\nProfile: Boris Johnson\nHow could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?\nRead more about the UK's referendum on the EU\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\".\nHe first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.\nHe still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.\nAs a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.\nLest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.\nThat's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.\nJust look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.\nNot quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.\nLast October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.\nBut none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.\nMr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.\nHe said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.\nBut Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.\nIn this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\"\nNo, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on.\nWhen Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\"\nNo, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump. Same hair though.\nNo, that's Julian Assange.","summary":"Foreign observers of the UK's debate on its forthcoming referendum on whether to stay in the European Union may have noticed an awful lot of fuss about the views of a man called Boris Johnson - yes, that man on the zip wire.","id":35633853}

In an ideal world we would approach this from both sides. But we don't live in an ideal world.\n\"We live in a world were thousands and thousands of women and children are being terrorised and brutalised in their homes and they have nowhere to go. And sadly, finding a refuge space in this country is like finding gold dust.\"\nAlthough there are already a number of schemes for perpetrators of domestic violence, the Drive project is intended to be different.\nIt is aimed at dangerous offenders, including those thought to be at risk of causing serious harm or committing murder.\nUnlike most existing schemes, which involve group work or family therapy, offenders on the Drive programme will be given bespoke one-to-one sessions.\nThey will be offered support to tackle any alcohol, drug or mental health problems they may have.\nAdvice about employment, housing and parenting will also be available.\nThose who refuse to co-operate will be monitored closely by police; civil court orders and criminal sanctions will be considered to disrupt their offending behaviour.\nDiana Barran, chief executive officer of SafeLives, said: \"Despite significant improvements for victim safety in the UK there are still 100,000 women who live with high-risk domestic abuse at any one time.\n\"If you do not hold perpetrators to account, we will continue to see the statistics at a standstill.\n\"Focusing on crisis management is of course vital but we want to help victims today and reduce the number of victims of tomorrow - and we can only do this by getting to the root and the cause of the problem - the perpetrator.\"\nIt is expected that 900 offenders will be asked to take part in the scheme over the next three years.\nIt also has support from Social Finance, a not-for-profit organisation, and is funded by police and crime commissioners in the three areas, as well as the Lloyds Bank Foundation for England and Wales and the Tudor Trust.","summary":"Men who pose a high risk of domestic violence are to be given one-to-one support to change their behaviour.","id":35591041}

{"document":"A letter from an NHS England official to managers and GPs in one region suggests vulnerable practices could be left to \"wither by the system\".\nThe note, seen by the BBC and Pulse magazine, claims NHS England is no longer able to \"continue supporting practices irrespective of their ability\u2026 to transform appropriately\".\nNHS England denied this was the case.\nA spokesman for the British Medical Association said it was \"unacceptable\" that some NHS managers believed that some GP practices would be left to close.\nA practice may be vulnerable due to:\nThese are often practices rated by regulators as \"inadequate\" or \"requiring improvement\".\nIt comes as media reports suggest much of a special fund to help struggling GP surgeries has not yet been handed out more than a year after it was unveiled. In June 2015, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced a \u00a310m investment in GP practices in England which were deemed to be vulnerable. This was formally launched by NHS England later in the year.\nBut last week, the medical publication Pulse reported that barely any of the fund had reached GPs.  Managers administering the fund in each area were said to be still identifying which vulnerable practices would qualify for the support.\nNHS England did not deny the report, though a source said the organisation was \"working through its local teams to ensure the funding available through the vulnerable practice programme is fully committed to named individual practices by the end of October\".\nAround 800 out of a total of 8,000 practices are deemed by NHS England to be in the vulnerable category. The criteria include a high number of patients per GP and an \"inadequate\" or \"requires improvement\" rating by the regulator, the CQC.\nNHS chiefs said the aim was to provide support for practices under pressure and to ensure patients had continued access to high quality care.\nIn April 2016, NHS England announced an extra \u00a316m for this year for a so-called \"practice resilience programme\", with another \u00a324m in subsequent years.\nThis pool of money was also aimed at shoring up struggling practices and was part of the GP Practice Forward View unveiled by the head of NHS England Simon Stevens.\nBut a letter sent by Paul Twomey, medical director of the NHS England North Yorkshire and Humber area team, to local GPs and health officials in August suggests a harder line stance.\nIn it he says: \"The message we need to communicate to general practice is the GP Practice Forward View must be about transformation and in that sense is not like a pilot.\"\nHe goes on to express his belief that local health leaders will understand that \"vulnerable practices must either transform and deliver a quality service or be allowed to fail and wither by the system. We are no longer in a position to continue supporting practices irrespective of their willingness or ability as a provider to transform appropriately.\"\nDr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association's GP committee said this approach was unacceptable.\nHe called on the government to deliver the funding immediately and \"deter a mindset amongst managers that some GP practices can be allowed to disappear\".\nAn NHS England spokesperson said: \"Rising patient demand is placing GPs under more pressure and that is why we are reversing the historic under-investment in general practice through a wide-ranging action plan, backed with half a billion pounds to support struggling practices.\n\"This includes a four-year, \u00a340m programme for helping the GP surgeries facing the most difficulties and further practical measures to stabilise general practice for the future.\"\nReferences to surgeries and practices being \"allowed to fail\" comes at a sensitive time in the debate about the state of NHS primary care in England.\nThere has been a steady stream of surgery closures and recruitment problems. GPs complain of a growing and sometimes intolerable workload.\nLast month 2,000 patients were left without a GP after a surgery was closed in Nottingham following an \"inadequate\" regulatory rating. They were advised to contact other surgeries nearby.\nIn July, an Oxfordshire doctor's surgery announced it would close because it claimed changes to the national GP contract made it \"financially unviable\" and two partners were due to retire. This week, a North Yorkshire practice said it would close in the New Year.\nNHS England, while promising to boost the share of the overall NHS budget going to general practice, has encouraged doctors to pool resources by forming \"super-partnerships\" and federations.\nImproving out-of-hours access and working more closely with community health services are also on the task list for GP groups. The underlying message is that more efficient ways of delivering care at a time of stretched resources are required.\nNHS chiefs are under pressure to find efficiency savings and a multitude of smaller practices might not be the best use of resources.\nBut the danger is that a process of modernisation and consolidation involving surgery closures could leave patients in some areas unable to get a GP appointment.","summary":"Some struggling GP surgeries in England will be allowed to fail and close, according to a leaked document.","id":37617114}
{"document":"In fact, the Swedish star has already lost five months to making her third album... and it's still not finished.\n\"I've been really geeking out,\" she giggles down the phone. \"Almost to a point where it's mathematical, trying to find the balance between all the elements\".\nWhen inspiration pounces, she can lose \"hours, days and weeks\" in the studio, \"just bending different sentences and rhymes to find the best fit, to find the missing piece of the puzzle\".\nPop, in particular, puts \"so much focus on what you say,\" she adds. \"You have to be really neat and concise. It's important you get it right.\n\"So it's about puzzling together a song, a good pop song, that makes sense. It really is a brain game.\"\nThe first result of all this effort is Say My Name, a gigantic pop fizzbomb that's primed to explode all over the charts this month.\nIt's a deceptively simple song built around a quirky ukulele riff, but the chorus sticks like Velcro.\n\"Say my name,\" sings the star, \"wear it out like a sweater that you love, cause I can't get enough when you... say my name\".\n\"I really love that chorus,\" she says. \"It was such a good feeling when we nailed that one. Like, 'Yes!'\"\nHer painstaking perfectionism reaches a pinnacle in the vocals. Tove is understated and conversational, making you lean in to the song's coquettish flirtation, where most pop divas would have belted out the melody in one take and gone home for a sandwich.\n\"I don't understand how people do that,\" she protests. \"I feel like the vocals are such a huge part of the production. Like, how do I sing this line? How much strength do I put into it? How can I make this melody as interesting as possible? How can I communicate this feeling even more.\"\n\"And it's the best feeling when you find that missing piece. It's like, 'Arrroooggahh!' Amazing.\"\nAnd if inspiration dries up?\n\"I play solitaire on my phone,\" laughs the singer. \"I have the song on in the background, and I play solitaire so I'm not concentrating so hard.\n\"It's a good way to make sure you don't overthink it. If you force the brain into shutting off then, suddenly, something will just come out of your mouth that fits.\"\nTove Anna Linn\u00c3\u00a9a \u00c3\u2013stman Styrke was born and raised in Umea, an unassuming university town near the edge of the Arctic Circle, whose most famous former inhabitant is Stieg Larsson, the author of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\nHer mother was a ballet teacher; while her father was a musician, whose band Max Fenders scored a number one hit in 1975 with the song Vindens Melodi (Wind Melody), and who set Tove on the path to musical stardom when he gave her her first synthesiser.\nAt the age of 16, she entered the TV talent show Swedish Idol, finishing in third place. It delivered her a solid fanbase, but she's not particularly enamoured of the experience.\n\"Its really hard to talk about music and a thing like Swedish Idol at the same time,\" she once said, \"because they have nothing to do with each other\".\n\"A competition like that, on TV, that's entertainment, that's a popularity competition... And afterwards, that's when you start making music.\"\nPost-Idol, Tove released a rushed, self-titled album which went platinum in Sweden. But she was unhappy with the way she was being presented, and took a three-year break, moving back home to immerse herself in music and work out who she wanted to be.\nThe result was Kiddo, her second album, written from the perspective of a young woman finding her voice in a world that constantly tries to undermine and break women down.\nIt featured pop's best put-down since You're So Vain (\"I bet you hit the ground hard when you fell for yourself\") and flicked two fingers at the men who tried to turn her into a flesh-baring pop zombie.\n\"Hot glam seems far away from where I am \/ I can neither understand it nor demand it,\" she stated on a track called Number One.\nStrident, sassy and self-confident, it's no surprise that the album was named after Uma Thurman's character in Kill Bill, Beatrix Kiddo. Time Magazine called it a \"feminist pop triumph\", while it made several critics' end-of-year lists in 2015.\nAlthough Kiddo didn't sell in the quantities expected of a mainstream pop record, it won the singer recognition from tastemakers on Radio 1, Billboard Magazine and Rolling Stone; while a tour with pop band Years & Years gained her some real world fans.\n\"Being the support act can be a tough job but I couldn't have chosen a better audience if I'd hand-picked them myself,\" she marvels.\n\"I noticed they had fans who come back to see multiple shows and, after a while, they were all as excited to see me as they were to see Years and Years.\n\"Just walking up on that stage and singing to that audience was amazing. That was the best thing.\"\nThe 24-year-old hopes to capitalise on all this goodwill with her new single - which has just been made track of the week by Radio 1's Greg James.\nIt sees the singer turn her keen lyrical eye towards love for the first time, a move which was prompted not by romance, but politics.\n\"Everybody here [in Sweden] was depressed when Trump won, and you can definitely [see] negative political trends happening in Europe, as well.\n\"With everything being kind of heavy, I'm writing more as a way to escape the world. I want to be able to zone out for a minute and have a good time.\"\nSay My Name will undoubtedly be seen as a litmus test for Tove's new material at a time when similarly-tipped female pop acts like M\u00c3\u02dc, Bebe Rexha and Dua Lipa have struggled to gain a foothold.\nBut the singer is undaunted, saying she has a secret stash of hit singles hidden back in Sweden.\n\"I'm going to sound so full of myself but, whatever, I'm a pop princess,\" she laughs.\n\"I really feel like every song I've done so far is single material. I don't want to see any of them as 'just an album track.'\"\nIn common with Calvin Harris, who has reportedly abandoned albums altogether, she is considering releasing music in a more ad hoc nature, either as a series of standalone singles or themed EPs.\n\"I really appreciate the album format sometimes,\" she explains. \"Like, Beyonce's Lemonade album wouldn't work as a collection of singles.\n\"But a lot of people, at least in my audience, just pick their favourite songs and add them to a playlist.\n\"That means there's a lot of songs I spend time on that people don't discover.

{"document":"A bill is being considered to bolster animal protection by barring any use of wild animals in travelling shows.\nMartin Burton of the Association of Circus Proprietors told MSPs that a law based on the proposed ethical grounds \"will eventually close your zoos\".\nA government consultation found widespread support for a formal ban.\nThe Wild Animals in Travelling Circuses (Scotland) Bill would be the first of its kind in the UK, and is aimed at banning the use of non-domesticated animals for either performance or exhibition.\nHolyrood's environment committee took evidence from a range of animal welfare and circus industry groups.\nMr Burton told members that there were no circuses with wild animals which have visited Scotland in recent times.\nHowever, he said a lack of clarity in the legislation about what constitutes a travelling circus and the definition of a wild animal, along with the emphasis on ethics, could have far-reaching consequences.\nHe said: \"The economic impact on animal displays in shopping centres, on displays at outdoors shows of hawks and wild birds, on reindeer and Santa, and eventually zoos will be massive.\n\"Eventually that is where this will all go, this will eventually close your zoos.\"\nHe added: \"Once you start banning things, particularly on ethical grounds, it is clear that this will spread, because if it's ethically not right to have a wild animal in a circus, then it is ethically not right to have a wild animal appear at a gala or a county show, and it is ethically not right to have a wild animal appear in a shopping centre, and it is ethically not right to have a wild animal appear in a zoo.\n\"It is clear and logical that that is the only way an ethical ban can go. You can't choose your ethics, you're either going to say it is ethical or it is not ethical.\"\nMeanwhile, Rona Brown from the Circus Guild of Great Britain said there was no scientific evidence of current welfare issues for wild animals in circuses, with government vets inspecting licensed circuses three times a year.\nHowever, members also heard from Dr Dorothy McKeegan, from the Institute of Biodiversity Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow, who said the arguments in the bill were valid.\nShe said the use of wild animals in the circus was disrespectful, and that there was a welfare argument as well as an ethical one to be made.\nMembers also heard from representatives of City of Edinburgh and Argyll and Bute councils, who said they did not allow circuses to use their land if they had wild animals.\nA government consultation in 2014 showed 98% of respondents thought the use of wild animals for performance in travelling circuses should be banned and 96.4% thought the use of wild animals for exhibition (without performing) should be banned.\nAnimal protection organisations such as the Born Free Foundation, Captive Animals' Protection Society and OneKind have also welcomed the move.","summary":"A ban on using wild animals in travelling circuses could eventually lead to zoos in Scotland being closed down, a circus leader has told MSPs.","id":40177870}

Does the first lady have presidential ambitions?\n\"Grace has been trying to increase her political capital in her own right, probably as a defence mechanism for when Mugabe does depart the scene,\" he said.\n\"That, I think, has been misinterpreted to some extent to suggest that she has presidential ambition.\"\nAfter a period of growth during a government of national unity, Zimbabwe's economy, its currency pegged to the dollar, continues to fall as investors shy away.\nMore than 80% of the government budget is spent on civil service salaries, and companies are laying off workers after a court ruling lifted the requirement to pay off sacked employees.\nPresident Mugabe publicly opposes the decision and used his speech to promise parliamentary action to put this right, but the party of the people knows the civil service expenditure is unsustainable and it's tempting to take advantage.\nIn central Harare, the trading spaces are taken up with second-hand clothes and shoes.\nAmong them are a former banker, who is just trying to make ends meet.\n\"It keeps me going,\" she says. \"Most industries are closing at the moment, so unemployment is a bit high, but if they open up industries, I'm sure things will improve.\"\nAnd a computer science student was optimistic she'd find work when she graduated.\n\"You have to be creative enough,\" she said. \"Like right now, selling these things - it's entrepreneurship - so for me it's cool.\"\nThe government has threatened a ban on pavement thrift stores, and some traders were forced away to stalls outside town a few weeks ago.\nThey've been labelled an eyesore, or unhygienic, but the informal economy doesn't generate tax receipts for the government, and with money short, people aren't spending in the shops.\n\"It's rugged my friend. The economy\u2026 it's not going anywhere, it's stagnant,\" says a taxi tout in an American football shirt.\n\"I'm a qualified accountant, but there's no jobs, you can't find employment anywhere, so I don't know what to do.\"\nIn his speech to the nation, President Mugabe admitted: \"We are still grappling with the task of transforming our economies,\" but he tried to reassure people things were on the up.\nThere were certainly plenty of tourists at Victoria Falls and the Hwange National Park last week, and Zimbabwe still sits on precious metals and diamonds, but foreign investment is the key and confidence is low.\nThe economic ideas of Emmerson Mnangagwa and his close ally, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa, are already impressing Western institutions and those too nervous to invest while the old man prevails.\nHis ambitions for open democracy may not be as advanced, but the right-hand man may be someone the international community can do business with.\nBut President Mugabe, leaning on his lectern as he delivers his speech, is a difficult man to read.\nAfter all these years, it's hard to see him settling on a successor and handing over power, unless he's thinking about his family and the political exposure they could face if he died in office.\nThe opposition takes the purge of Joice Mujuru and the internal split in Zanu-PF as a sign of some hope, but it may have had the opposite effect and made a cleaner succession much easier.\nThey are arguably even more divided and unprepared to challenge for power, after losing unfair elections and then failing to gain from a unity government.\nThe cult of personality wins votes in Zimbabwe, which explains why Morgan Tsvangirai still leads the Movement for Democratic Change and holds hopes of one day being president.\nAfter 15 years of trying, he's still passionate in his words at least.\n\"We are not waiting for him to die,\" he said. \"We have always done what we believe every struggle should do - you mobilise the people, you re-energise the base.\n\"You continue giving people the hope that a democratic alternative is a possibility.\"\nBut the strength of those on the podium, alongside the huge golden statue of liberation heroes, still hold the future of this country in their hands.","summary":"The huge golden statue of three liberation soldiers - two men and a woman - form the centrepiece of Heroes' Acre, the monument to Zimbabwe's fallen.","id":33866654}

{"document":"Born in Malaysia, of southern Indian heritage, he came here with his family 22 years ago, aged 13, and is now an up-and-coming presenter on the ABC news channel, News 24. He is one of the national broadcaster's rising stars.\nThis past week, however, in a classic case of a newsman himself making headlines, he has been the focus of a national conversation about Australian racism, having been the victim of the kind of ugly racist incident that usually goes unreported.\nMr Fernandez was riding on a bus through inner Sydney, when a small girl started pinching and flicking his two-year-old daughter.\nTo offer protection from what he thought was some pretty harmless child's play, he put his arm around his daughter, but still the girl persisted and then started flicking him. \"That was my arm,\" he told the child, at which point her mother let racist rip.\n\"She began hurling abuse and accused me of reaching behind our seats and touching her daughter,\" he recalled afterwards. \"Of course, I had not done anything of the sort.\"\nThen came the racist onslaught, which he described as \"the longest 15 minutes of my life\". His two-year-old daughter heard every single word of the rant, which culminated in foul-mouthed abuse.\nAlighting from the bus, he described to the driver what had happened. \"It's your fault, mate,\" responded the driver. \"You could have moved.\"\nIn the week that Americans celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birth of one of the great heroines of the struggle for black equality, Mr Fernandez described it as his very own \"Rosa Parks moment\". After dropping off his daughter at daycare, he cried.\nJeremy Fernandez shared the episode with his followers on Twitter, and it soon went viral.\n\"Anyone who says racism is dying is well and truly mistaken,\" he wrote, as part of a series of tweets. \"It's a sad thing when a coloured man in 2013 has to show his kid how to hold their nerve in the face of racist taunts.\" The conversation had started.\n\"Most people don't talk about this stuff,\" says Fernandez. \"That's why I think it touched a nerve. I honestly thought it would generate a bit of discussion for a couple of hours. I had no idea it would take off.\" Since last Friday, he has been contacted by about 6000 people.\nRacism has been part of the Australian story since the moment of white settlement in 1788. During the Gold Rush of the late 19th Century, fears that an overwhelmingly white nation could be overrun by non-whites bordered on the paranoid.\nThe White Australia policy, which restricted non-white immigration and which survived until the early 1970s, became in 1901 one of the first legislative acts of the new Australian parliament. The modern-day Australian story, however, is one of multicultural success.\nJust after World War II, over 90% of the 7.5 million Australians were of Anglo-Celtic stock. Since then, the population has tripled, with close to 45% of the population having at least one parent born in a foreign country. Now over 260 languages are spoken in Australia, and the country is made up of people with 270 different ancestries.\nFew countries have experienced such massive and rapid demographic change with such little violent backlash and rancour. Part of the reason why the Cronulla riot in 2005 was so jolting, for example, was because these kinds of racist eruptions were so exceptional.\nThe rise in the mid-1990s of Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party also cuts both ways. Revelling in her notoriety, the Queensland fish and chip shop owner came to personify Australian intolerance. Yet Hansonism proved a short-lived phenomenon, and its one-time figurehead is now a figure of fun.\nToday, there is no Australian equivalent of the British National Party. Nor is there an equivalent of the National Front, the English Defence League or other European far-right groups.\nRacial abuse and insensitivity, however, is widespread, which goes some way towards explaining why the country is often cast as a \"redneck nation\" - not least by Australians themselves. The tabloid and political hysteria surrounding the asylum seeker issue has echoes of a past in which a predominantly white nation felt insecure in a predominantly non-white region.\nThe comedian Barry Humphries, better known perhaps as Dame Edna Everage, struck a chord when he noted: \"Xenophobia is love of Australia.\"\nBut in an important new book, \"Don't Go Back to Where You Came From: why Multiculturalism Works,\" the academic Tim Soutphommasane argues that Australia now rivals Canada as the world's most successful multicultural country.\nThere has never been \"a numerically significant underclass of immigrants,\" he notes. Australia is one of the few OECD nations where the children of immigrants \"constitute a higher proportion of people in highly skilled occupations than the children of natives\".\nResidential segregation is not a is not a problem. Interracial marriage rates, a key indicator of ethnic integration, are high. By the third generation, a majority of Australians of non-English-speaking background marry partners with a different ethnic heritage.\nMr Soutphommasane bemoans the under-representation of immigrants in boardrooms, senior management, the military and parliament, which boasts just three lawmakers from non-European backgrounds, and highlights the problem of workplace discrimination.\nAs an immigrant himself - his parents were refugees from Laos - he has also been the victim of abuse and vilification, which he describes vividly in his book. Nonetheless, he argues: \"Australia has done multiculturalism well.\"\n\"Episodes like Jeremy's happen every day,\" he says, \"but they're not wholly representative of Australian society.\"\n\"It's important to resist the temptation for reflexive self-flagellation on racism,\" he adds. \"We tend to think of ourselves as the worst in the world, and we're not. We can some sometimes ignore the big picture, although these cases underscore the fragility of our achievement.\"\nJeremy Fernandez agrees that \"Australia is not a racist country\", but that these kind of ugly episodes are dispiriting. \"Even if it is once a month,\" he says, \"that's a lifetime of it happening 12 times a year.\"\nStill, the huge public response, online and in person, has heartened him.  \"It's overwhelmingly been message of goodwill,\" he says. \"That needs to speak as loudly as the incident itself.\"","summary":"Jeremy Fernandez could easily be the face of the new Australia, a poster-boy of immigrant success.","id":21468892}

Flights and other public transport were halted.\nHagupit has been nowhere near as powerful as Typhoon Haiyan - known as Yolanda in the Philippines - which tore through the central Philippines in November 2013, leaving more than 7,000 dead or missing.\nIn Tacloban, Hagupit blew away roofs and flooded streets, but the area has escaped the wider devastation of last year.\n\"There were no bodies scattered on the road, no big mounds of debris,\" local woman Rhea Estuna told the Associated Press by phone from Tacloban. \"Thanks to God this typhoon wasn't as violent.\"\nTacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez told the BBC that the immediate task was assessing damage to the temporary shelters in which some people have been living.\nHe said that the weather was good now but that high tides were making it harder for waterways to drain, despite work to clear debris.\nUN official Orla Fagan told Reuters that a lot of people have begun returning to their homes. \"In Tacloban this morning, the sun is shining, people just started going back,\" she said.\nThe storm made its fourth landfall on Monday night, hitting Batangas province some 100km (60 miles) south of Manila with winds of roughly 100km\/h.\nAt its height, as it approached land on Saturday, gusts of up to 250km\/h were recorded.\nThe authorities said they were better prepared than when Haiyan struck, and organised the largest peacetime evacuation in the history of the Philippines.\nJustin Morgan, Oxfam country director for the Philippines, told the BBC that a key factor was a greater focus on the dangers of storm surges, meaning people were moved away from coastal areas.\nJoey Salceda, governor of Albay province, told the BBC no casualties and only \"negligible damage\" had been reported in his province.\nHe said the storm had been identified as a threat in late November, giving officials time to identify population at risk, evacuate them two days ahead of the storm and prepare food supplies.\nKnown locally as Typhoon Ruby, Hagupit has nonetheless caused major damage in several towns in the east.\nThe Philippine Red Cross said at least 21 people had died over the weekend, with 18 of those on the eastern island of Samar, where Hagupit made landfall on Saturday.\nThe mayor of Dolores, a town on Samar, said that 80% of homes there had been destroyed. One resident reportedly died after a tree fell on him.\nTwo more people - a one-year-old girl and a 65-year-old man - died from hypothermia in the central province of Iloilo, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said.\nA total of 183 flights had been cancelled and five airports closed, the agency said, and there were power outages in 16 provinces.","summary":"Tropical storm Hagupit is heading to Manila, but has been downgraded from a typhoon after crossing the country.","id":30370012}

I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders.\"\nElena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about \u00a310,800; $17,000) to those four banks.\nAfter the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (\u00a3107; $167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job.\nMillions of those in debt live like Elena.\nAccording to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages.\nBy June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months.\nThe Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (\u00a310.7bn; $16.7bn). At least 10% of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks.\nFor Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones.\nIt all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions.\n\"We were a bit stupid,\" Elena says. \"They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself.\"\nDuring Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about.\nThen the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict.\nThe average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles.\nOlga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because \"the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals\". Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says.\nDebtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October.\nRussian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead.\nEach debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution.\nA former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: \"I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!\"\nMr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51% to 33% and \"this year it's probably going to be around 16%\".\nHe had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow.\nMr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents.\nHis father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. \"How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was.\"\nBesides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance.\nAnd now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage. The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling.\n\"There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages?\" Vladimir wonders. But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma.\n\"Isn't there a law against this?\" asks his father, equally helplessly. \"How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first?\"\nAfter the good years many Russians are now getting a harsh lesson in capitalism - and inadequate regulations mean there is nothing to soften the blow.","summary":"Millions of Russians took out loans during the economic boom years, but now they face crippling debts and the law is not on their side, the BBC's Oleg Boldyrev reports.","id":33717488}

This preventative measure should be accompanied by high-quality sex and relationships education,\" he added.\nStonewall Cymru said it will now press the Welsh Government to make the drug available in the longer term.\nIt is not the first time a Welsh health minister has gone against advice over the cost of a drug.\nFour years ago, then Health Minister Mark Drakeford approved the use of cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco which was estimated at costing NHS Wales up to \u00c2\u00a3180,000 per patient per year.\nNeath AM Jeremy Miles, patron of LGBT Labour Wales, said: \"We must take all appropriate action against preventable HIV transmission and the Welsh Government is listening to clinical experts who know the positive impact Prep could have alongside other measures to encourage safer sex.\"","summary":"A \"game-changing\" drug which dramatically cuts the chances of HIV infection will be provided in Wales as part of a three year trial.","id":39744815}

However, the developer has stated that his decision to pull the title was \"not anything related to legal issues\".\nAfter Mr Dong took the game down, many fans turned to social media to petition for its return.\nOn Twitter, there were widely-used hashtags of #RIPFlappyBird and #SaveFlappyBird, with several \"Save Flappy Bird\" accounts being spawned as well.\nThe game is no longer available through online stores, but it still works on phones that had previously downloaded it.\nAs a result, some online users have offered to sell their smartphones still containing the Flappy Birds app for large sums of money.\nHowever, some fans expressed their relief that the game was gone.\nOne user describes Flappy Birds as \"an addictive game that everyone hates to love\" while another said, \"I think it's for the best, and for the best of all the cracked phones out there.\"\nAt least one user has tweeted a photo of a cracked iPhone screen  - apparently as a result of frantic tapping whilst playing the game.","summary":"Flappy Bird is flapping its wings no more.","id":26114364}

NHS bosses have said there is no room for complacency.\nThe service is run by different organisations in each area, including private companies, ambulance trusts and NHS Direct - which ran the old telephone advice line.\nDiscussions are already taking place with other providers, particularly the ambulance trusts, to see who could take over from NHS Direct.\nNHS Direct announced in June that it was pulling out of two areas - Cornwall and North Essex - even before the services were launched.\nAnd earlier this month, it warned that the volume of calls at two of its larger contracts, North West and West Midlands, were 30-40% lower than contracted  leading to lower income and leaving its whole 111 service \"financially unsustainable\".\nNHS Direct used to be paid more than \u00a320 per call when it ran the old 0845 number. The payment is between \u00a37 and \u00a39 per call for the new 111 service.\nProjections reported earlier this month showed NHS Direct had lost \u00a32.8m since April and was \"heading for a deficit of \u00a326m if we continue to run the same volume of 111 services until the end of this financial year\".\nThe organisation is now seeking a \"managed transfer\" of its 111 contracts, which have between two and five years left to run, to another provider.\nNHS Direct has already pulled out of contracts for 111 services in Cornwall and North Essex\nNick Chapman, the chief executive of NHS Direct, said: \"We will continue to provide a safe and reliable NHS 111 service to our patients until alternative arrangements can be made by commissioners.\n\"Whatever the outcome of the discussions on the future, patients will remain the central focus of our efforts, together with protecting our staff who work on NHS 111 to ensure that the service will continue to benefit from their skills and experience.\"\nThe health minister Lord Howe accused NHS Direct of \"losing control of the ball\" and said the majority of the country was getting a good service.\n\"Their problem, I'm afraid, is that they got their sums wrong, which is very disappointing,\" he added.\nThe whole 111 service was meant to be up and running in April.\nHowever, many areas were not ready and only half of services were operational by May.

Absolutely. It's very hard to deal with.\nIt's very mentally and physically draining, but it's equally very rewarding in different ways.\nWhen the final whistle went at the weekend it made every second of the season worthwhile. The juice was definitely worth the squeeze.\nBeing a manager is a very difficult thing to do and you have to have a very good group of players and coaches for it to work. Thankfully and luckily we did have that.\nI have thought about getting into coaching, but the way this came about was more to do with circumstances than anything else.\nOur head coach (Jo Montemurro) went into our men's side as an assistant and I stepped up. It was a natural thing, really.\nWe were so far into the season that it was probably going to be the least disruptive for everyone involved.\nI didn't think twice about it when the (Melbourne) City group asked me to do the job.\nEqually I knew that it would be OK with the group that we had, because we have a very, very good group of girls.\nFor me, at the stage of my career, this is the best of both worlds.\nI want to learn how to coach and how to develop as a coach and I believe I'm in the best place for that.\nBut I'm not anywhere near retiring right now so I'm still playing and loving my football.\nI believe coaching educates me as a player as much as me learning as a coach pushes me out of my comfort zone.\nAfter an absolutely amazing experience in Melbourne, I head home soon to meet up with Wales ahead of the Cyprus Cup.\nI'm going to stay with Wales for another campaign after briefly considering international retirement and am really excited to get back to prepare for our World Cup campaign that will start later this year.\nMy experiences with Melbourne can stand me in really good stead for Wales and my American club side Seattle Reign.\nI just go as a player to those camps, but I do have experience in leading groups and being a good person who helps when they're in a bit of trouble or being successful.\nThe experience of this whole campaign I've just had with City is probably one of a kind.\nI certainly want to continue in football beyond playing, but who knows if the opportunity will ever be there to coach in the men's game.\nI think it'll be a lot easier for women to go into the male game in the future, in the right environment, as I had in Melbourne.\nAt Melbourne, everyone believes in and supports each other and the crossover between male and female is very similar and even.\nIn that environment I can't see it being a problem. But that environment is not replicated all over the world.\nSome clubs would be very receptive to a female coach, other clubs less so.\nBut luckily, that is not something I have to worry about for a good few years yet!","summary":"I have certainly had worse 24 hours in my life than winning the Grand Final with Melbourne City and then being named in the Wales squad for the Cyprus Cup.","id":38959914}

{"document":"At the Paris climate summit last December, governments agreed that they would \"pursue efforts\" to keep warming below this figure.\nBut a new study shows the limit will be breached over land, even if emissions of warming gases ceased immediately.\nThe research has been published in the journal Scientific Reports.\nAround 180 countries have so far signed the Paris climate agreement in which they pledged not only to limit the global temperature rise since pre-industrial times to \"well below\" 2C but to do their very best to keep them to 1.5C.\nThe lower target was crucial in gaining the support of small island states and the poorest developing countries. Rallying around the slogan, \"1.5 to stay alive,\" they have argued their very survival is at stake with the rise in sea levels and the increase in storms that this amount of warming would bring.\nBut as recorded temperatures this year have edged above 1C, scientists believe we are already \"dancing\" with the 1.5 degree target.\nThis new study suggests that it will \"almost certainly be surpassed\", at least over land, based on the amount of CO2 already in the atmosphere.\n\"Even if we just had a planet where we could prevent greenhouse gases going up any further, there would be an additional warming over land, in many places if not most it would 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels,\" said lead author Dr Chris Huntingford from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.\nThe researchers say there are two reasons behind the finding.  The first is the fact that much of the heat created in the Earth's greenhouse is currently subsumed into the oceans.\nThe authors argue that this sea sink will decline as the world cuts emissions of CO2 and other warming gases, putting more heat into the air.\nThis will combine with the second reason, namely that warming rates over land are far higher than those over the oceans.\n\"At the moment the oceans are drawing down a vast amount of heat from the atmosphere,\" said Dr Huntingford, \"but as you stabilise the climate you get to the position where these net fluxes of heat actually become zero, and that would correspond to a higher temperature.\"\nOther researchers agree that keeping temperatures at the 1.5 figure is going to be a significant, if not impossible, challenge.\n\"In my opinion we should work for as low a target as possible,\" said Dr Gavin Schmidt from Nasa, who was not involved with the study.\n\"But we should be prepared for worse.\"\nThe authors of the latest paper say that it was a good idea to have an \"aspirational\" 1.5 degree target in the Paris agreement.\nEmissions are going down they say and the uptake of renewable and green sources of energy is happening more quickly than expected.\nBut if the world is to take the 1.5 target seriously, then a serious discussion needs to be held about the implications of that goal.\n\"I think there needs to be a very thoughtful debate about what's to be gained at these different temperature levels, if approaching the lower levels meant severely damaging the economy,\" said Dr Huntingford.\n\"Every climate scientist realises that when you write that we have to get emissions down to hit this target that could potentially push the world into a global recession - so we need to be really clear about what's to be gained by aiming for 1.5 that might be extremely difficult for society rather than 2 degrees.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook.","summary":"Scientists are calling for a \"thoughtful debate\" about the wisdom of attempts to keep a global rise in temperatures under 1.5C.","id":36904990}

It is up to hospitals to negotiate their own rates for extra work, with the most lucrative ones in place for routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.\nConsultants doing overtime in these areas commonly make \u00a3600 for a four-hour shift - three to four times what they normally get. Overtime for urgent and emergency work tends to be much lower - around \u00a3300 for a shift.\nOf Scotland's 14 health boards, 12 responded to the freedom of information requests. This showed spending going up from \u00a314.27m in 2013\/14 to \u00a320.92m in 2015\/16.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde paid out the most, with an outlay of \u00a37,749,870 on higher rate payments for additional shifts, while NHS Orkney did not make any payments.\nNHS Grampian had the greatest increase in payments, from zero in 2013\/14 to \u00a31.6m two years later.\nThere were also sharp increases at NHS Lanarkshire, from \u00a31.8m to \u00a33.4m, and NHS Lothian, from \u00a31.3m to \u00a32.1m.\nA number of hospitals asked about the payments UK-wide said there was a shortage of consultants, meaning they had to try to get existing staff to do extra work.\nThey also said high emergency-room pressures had led to the cancellation of more routine treatments, increasing the need for overtime.\nA spokesman for the British Medical Association said: \"The fact is the NHS is only paying overtime on this scale because it does not have enough doctors to do the work.\"\nHowever, Scotland's health secretary insisted that consultant staffing was at a record high.\nMs Robison said: \"NHS consultant numbers have increased by almost 43% under this government to a record high level. This spend on overtime represents a tiny percentage of the overall spend on consultants.\n\"We are determined to eradicate high cost overtime payments in NHS Scotland, which is why we have launched a national programme for the effective management of all temporary staffing, to help boards move away from reliance on high cost temporary staff, reduce overall costs and ensure value for money for NHS Scotland.\n\"We have also set up and championed the use of local 'staff bank' systems, which are a pool of flexible NHS-employed staff who fill the majority of short term vacant shifts at NHS pay rates. Work is now underway to develop these local banks into integrated regional and national staff banks to allow greater flexibility across NHS Scotland and minimise reliance on agency staff.\n\"In the meantime the use of overtime and locum staff allows NHS Boards to respond to periods of planned and unplanned absence including long term sickness, unexpected vacancies and maternity and paternity leave ensuring service continuity during these times.\"","summary":"Growing pressures on hospitals are forcing them to ramp up costly overtime payments to consultants to do extra work, a BBC investigation shows.","id":36897564}

{"document":"A new report from the Centre for Cities and the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, said all cities would see a fall in output due to increasing trade costs.\nAberdeen and Edinburgh were both ranked among the ten most affected cities.\nHowever the study said both cities are also among the best-placed to respond to any predicted economic turbulence.\nThe study excludes Belfast as the authors said data for Northern Ireland was not available.\nThe UK government said it was committed to securing a \"bold and ambitious\" free trade deal and building on the diverse strengths of all the UK's cities and regions.\nMeanwhile, Scottish and Welsh government ministers have met in Cardiff to discuss Brexit legislation.\nEarlier in July, business advisers PwC said uncertainty about Brexit was having a negative impact on the Scottish economy and housing market.\nThe London-based Centre for Cities think-tank said all UK cities faced \"significant economic challenges\" as the UK leaves the EU due to a predicted increase in trading costs.\nThey produced predicted reductions in economic output for each of the country's cities, for both the scenario of a so-called \"soft\" Brexit - with the UK joining a free trade area such as the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) - or a \"hard\" Brexit, where the UK does not come to an immediate deal with the EU and defaults to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\nThe researchers said either scenario would result in an increase in non-tariff barriers, such as customs checks, border controls, differences in product market regulations and legal hurdles, all increasing the cost of trade.\nUnder both models, the group predicted that local trade flows and employment shares meant Aberdeen would see the largest reduction in output, measured by gross value added, over the next ten years - of 3.7% under the \"hard\" Brexit scenario, or of 2.1% under a \"soft\" Brexit.\nEdinburgh was ranked sixth in the table in both models, with reductions of 2.7% and 1.4% respectively. Other cities which feature on the tables include London, Reading, Leeds and Swindon.\nHowever, the researchers said the factors which made the cities likely to suffer in the short term also made them well-placed to respond.\nThey said the cities were \"home to large, highly-skilled labour markets, significant numbers of innovative firms and strong business networks - all of which are crucial in enabling a city to reinvent or adapt its industrial structure to changing economic circumstances\".\nProf Stephen Machin from the Centre for Economic Performance said: \"The fact that the industrial specialisation and the skill and knowledge intensity of different places are key to local impact should be of significant importance to the design and implementation of policy, especially in the arenas of industrial, skills and labour market strategies.\"\nA UK government spokesman said: \"We are committed to a bold and ambitious free trade agreement that works for the whole of the UK.\n\"The government is engaging extensively with businesses and organisations across the country, and will continue this work throughout the exit process.\n\"Through the government's modern industrial strategy we will look to build on the diverse strengths of all of the UK's cities and regions.\"\nScottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie contended that Brexit would have a \"significant negative impact\" regardless of the deal secured, saying the government \"cannot just wave these numbers away\".\nHe said: \"People last year did not vote to make themselves poorer. The question on the ballot paper was not whether we wanted to destroy our economy and the prosperity of our cities. Giving the people a chance to exit from Brexit with a vote on the deal is the right and democratic thing to do.\"\nScottish Labour said the report showed the importance protecting jobs and the economy as part of the Brexit deal.\nShadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said: \"There should be a jobs-first Brexit, to ensure that our cities such as Aberdeen and Edinburgh can continue to grow. Jobs, the economy and retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union are our top priority.\"\nMeanwhile, Scottish and Welsh ministers have met in Cardiff to discuss the EU Withdrawal Bill, the legislation planned by the UK government to begin extricating the country from Europe's legal framework.\nScottish Brexit minister Mike Russell and Lord Advocate James Wolffe sat down with Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford and Welsh government's top lawyer, Counsel General Mick Antoniw.\nThe devolved administrations fear the legislation could see them lose powers over areas such as fishing and agriculture. The UK government denies this, and says the legislatures will actually gain powers as a result of Brexit.","summary":"Aberdeen could be the city worst hit by falling economic output due to a \"hard\" Brexit, experts have predicted.","id":40734848}

{"document":"BBC director general Tony Hall set out plans for the next decade, saying the corporation will become an \"open BBC for the internet age\".\nA children's iPlayer and a pool of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are also planned.\nYet he said funding cuts would mean the loss or reduction of some services.\nLord Hall laid out the plans at the Science Museum on Monday, ahead of the BBC's charter renewal in 2016.\nCiting the importance of \"excellence without arrogance\", he said his plans did not signal \"an expansionist BBC\".\nHe did warn, however, that funding cuts would mean it would \"inevitably have to either close or reduce some services\", without specifying which areas might be under threat.\nNew initiatives will include an Ideas Service, which Lord Hall said would be an \"open online platform\" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the corporation itself.\nHe said: \"Our new, open BBC will act as a curator bringing the best from Britain's great cultural institutions and thinkers to everyone.\n\"Britain has some of the greatest cultural forces in the world. We want to join with them, working alongside them, to make Britain the greatest cultural force in the world.\n\"We are extremely ambitious for this new service.\n\"Where Google's mission is to organise the world's information, ours in a smaller way would be to understand it. We will work with anyone who can help us understand this ever more complex world.\"\nThe government launched a consultation on the BBC's Royal Charter, which sets out the purpose of the BBC and how it will be governed, in July, promising to ask \"hard questions\" about the corporation's size and ambition.\nOther BBC plans include:\nThe director general also said he wanted to enable \"producers, directors, writers, artists to have the creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere\".\nQuality drama will also be a priority, he said, and the BBC will make \"bigger and bolder series\" that will be made available on the iPlayer in their entirety.\nPhysicist and BBC presenter Professor Brian Cox also announced a science strand named The New Age of Wonder, which will be part of the Ideas Service and will be created in partnership with organisations like the Royal Institution.\n\"This is not an expansionist BBC\" is perhaps the key political line in today's announcements.  This is a response to the accusation that the corporation is \"imperial in its ambitions\" made by Chancellor George Osborne (along with several newspapers).\nPartnerships with cultural bodies, sharing news with local newspapers, opening up the iPlayer to third party content - the mood music is all about co-operation rather than competition.\nThe second theme can be seen most clearly in the plans for bigger and bolder drama and giving people the chance to \"binge\" watch. The BBC is in a global marketplace - Netflix, Amazon, Google, Apple and HBO - the traditional media landscape is being blown apart.\nThe BBC's problem is looking after its core audience and responding to a technological transformation.  It will take money and the BBC has just taken a \u00c2\u00a3650m cut.  Those \"tough choices\" mentioned in the speech is the theme that has not yet been announced.\nLord Hall described the recent agreement by the BBC to cover the \u00c2\u00a3600m cost of providing free television licences for over-75s as a \"tough deal\" that would require \"some very difficult choices\" to be made.\nHe said: \"Having already saved 40% of the BBC's revenues in this charter period, we must save close to another 20% over the next five years.\"\nDetails of how those savings will be made and which services might be under threat will be announced in the coming months, he added.\nIn a charter review proposals document published on Monday, however, the BBC suggests that \"some existing services\" might no longer be needed in future.\n\"Streaming news may replace rolling news,\" the document states. \"Children may prefer iPlay to scheduled television.

{"document":"But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices.\nThe study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools.\nMany pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations.\nThe rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home.\nTablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group.\nBut researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.\nThe highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.\nThe underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.\nBetween 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.\nBut Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.\nResearchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.\nBut Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.\nAnd there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.\nDr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.\n\"The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,\" she said.\nA separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.\nIt showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.\nThe study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.\nWithin a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \"addicts\".\nAbout two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.\nFindings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.\nIt showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.\nSimon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.\nEach pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.\nUsing these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in \"the current century and not the last\".\nThe benefits are \"difficult to put into league tables\", he says. But they create a \"sense of empowerment\" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel \"trusted and valued\".\nTablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.\nThe head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.\n\"I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,\" said Mr Mason.","summary":"Almost 70% of primary and secondary schools in the UK now use tablet computers, according to research.","id":30216408}

Some were banging on the windows and shouting \"Germany, Germany.\"\nFollow our live updates\nEU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives.\nMany of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum.\nNothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across.\nThere were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting \"Germany! Germany!\" The police put on riot gear.\nAnd then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting \"help! help!\" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions.\nInternational services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely.

Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total.\nThe surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not.\nMr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were \"full of fear\" because \"they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation\".\nDuring a tense press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, the Hungarian leader said that \"nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia.\n\"All of them would like to go to Germany,\" he said. \"Our job is only to register them.\"\nMr Schulz countered: \"What we are seeing for the time being is egoism instead of common European sense.\n\"To say 'yeah, you know we have refugees all over in Europe but they all want to go to Germany and therefore we are not concerned' is effective, but wrong. And therefore I think we need a fair and just distribution.\"\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that EU countries should accept at least 100,000 asylum seekers between them, a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000.\nEU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece.\nMr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said his country was being \"overrun\" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots.\nHe said: \"Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice.\"\nThe human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece.\nImages of the washed-up body of a three-year-old boy, who died alongside his mother and five-year-old brother, circulated widely on social media.\nCzech unease at migrant numbering\nFive obstacles to an EU migrants deal\nThose who risk everything for a better life\nThe word migrant is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"one who moves, either temporarily or permanently, from one place, area, or country of residence to another\".\nA refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who \"owing to a well-founded fear\" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to seek the protection of that country.

{"document":"Across the world, drug laws are being relaxed, from Uruguay to Portugal, Jamaica and the Czech Republic.\nDoes this mean the war on drugs has been lost?\nThe BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses, including a former Colombian president and a drugs prosecutor turned defence lawyer.\nAfter many years prosecuting drugs offences as an Assistant US Attorney, growing frustration with the approach inspired Bonny Klapper to become a defence attorney.\n\"About 10 years into my career, it really hit me that the people I was prosecuting were not just drug traffickers. They were mothers, they were fathers, and I really began to take an interest in why these individuals got involved in drug trafficking.\"\nOne Colombian drug runner had a big impact:\n\"At 14 he had a choice: go work in the emerald mines, or do something else.  So he started in the emerald mines, and it was a horrible experience. And then he was offered the chance to work as a driver for one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Cartel. He started as a driver, and ultimately rose up through the ranks.\n\"In countries like Colombia,  sometimes if you want to support your family - and you don't come from a wealthy family or you're not highly educated - drugs is the only path that you have to get yourself out of poverty.\"\nShe noticed other problems back in the US at the other end of the chain:\n\"[We] would prosecute money remitter houses in Queens that were sending drug money to Colombia.  We prosecuted one, we shut it down, and the next day another one opened up in the same location. Or we prosecuted very high level traffickers, either in the US or in Colombia, and once they were extradited, someone else came in to take their place.\n\"We've shifted the problem from Colombia to Mexico. Now all of Central America is inundated because the traffickers got sophisticated, and they're moving through Guatemala and Honduras, and those countries are turning into narco states.\"\nShe argues the approach to drugs users is equally flawed:\n\"The prison system is a disaster. There's virtually no rehabilitation. Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective, because they go to jail, they come out, they get involved with drugs again, and they go right back to it.\n\"I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents I've worked with [but] so many of them have said to me 'we're fighting a war that can't be won the way we're fighting it'.\n\"The war itself is at a draw. And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless there's a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking.\"\nFormer Colombian President Cesar Gaviria worked on the Global Commission on Drug Policy report in 2011 which called on states to decriminalise drugs.\n\"Our recommendation is regulation for everything. That's what Portugal did.\n\"If you look at the last 50 years, what has been done? In the US, 600,000 people in jail, $40bn (\u00c2\u00a327bn) of spending a year. The highest rates of consumption of the whole world. You have to say that it doesn't work. It's a failed policy, and public opinion knows that.\n\"Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis.\n\"That taboo has been broken. In the US, a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana.\"\nHe cites the example of Uruguay, the first country to legalise the marijuana trade.\n\"All Latin America's looking at Uruguay. It's a country that also looks how to deal with the production, with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands.\n\"I don't expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place.\n\"From the beginning in 1961, the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs, but it's a utopia.  It's something unreachable.  It's not to recognise human nature.\"\nFormer chief scientist in the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control David Murray insists the billions of dollars spent tackling drug traffickers and destroying coca crops were well spent:\n\"A 75% reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians themselves.\n\"That's been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than 45% drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets\n\"This is a global business. As a global business they have their preferred mode of operation where they would like to be with regard to supply routes - ungoverned safe havens where they would like to be to carry out their business with maximum efficiency.\n\"When you push them off of that spot they will adapt but they are diminished.\n\"We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don't have to do the hard and dirty work, but that's not the reality on the ground.\n\"The reality is it's a tough slog, it is a cancer and it is worth fighting. Sure it's discouraging to see drug use continue but it actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to it.\"\nProfessor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland has been a leading academic in the field of drugs policy for decades.\n\"The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric.\n\"The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs, and signal to the population that [being tough on drugs] was a priority was an important part of the war itself.\n\"There's going to be less and less of that. I think there's going to be a change both in tone and substance, so the 'war on drugs' will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy. I think it's going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future.\n\"I do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition.  And we have a sense that that did not work well. And so we're now trying to find better ways of managing the problem, and I think that's welcome.\n\"If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences, at least in the US, that's an important indicator of the change in real policy, and those numbers are starting to go down.  Not dramatically, but they are definitely going down, and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline.\"\nAs drug laws soften he argues the question of regulation becomes key, as happened when gambling was legalised:\n\"Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing, you legalised it because you wanted to take money away from organised crime, but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters.\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service, Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT\nListen to the programme\nDownload the programme\n\"You have slogans like 'Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily?', just the kind of slogan you'd associate with the worst commercial promotion, but done by the state.\n\"Alcohol is still heavily promoted, and it's promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies, and we've only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions.\n\"So I think there's considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana, and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where it is commercially available, it's regulated, like alcohol, what we see is very aggressive promotion, advertising.\n\"You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation won't lead to more marijuana dependence.\n\"Choose your problem. There is no solution. Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems. We manage it. And we may manage it better or worse, but the notion that we solve a problem is simplistic. We're simply managing a problem.\"\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT.

{"document":"Most incidents came during the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union battled for influence across the continent.\nCIA covert operations are by their very nature hard to prove definitively. But research into the agency's work, as well as revelations by former CIA employees, has thrown up several cases where the agency tried to influence events.\nHere are four examples:\nPatrice Lumumba became the first prime minister of the newly-independent Congo in 1960, but he lasted just a few months in the job before he was overthrown and assassinated in January 1961.\nIn 2002, former colonial power Belgium admitted responsibility for its part in the killing, however, the US has never explained its role despite long-held suspicions.\nUS President Dwight D Eisenhower, concerned about communism, was worried about Congo following a similar path to Cuba.\nAccording to a source quoted in Death in the Congo, a book about the assassination, President Eisenhower gave \"an order for the assassination of Lumumba. There was no discussion; the [National Security Council] meeting simply moved on\".\nHowever, a CIA plan to lace Lumumba's toothpaste with poison was never carried out, Lawrence Devlin, who was a station chief in Congo at the time, told the BBC in 2000.\nA survey of declassified US government documents from the era notes that the CIA \"initially focussed on removing Lumumba, not only through assassination if necessary but also with an array of non-lethal undertakings\".\nWhile there is no doubt the CIA wanted him dead, the survey does not indicate direct US involvement in his eventual killing.\nGhana's first President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966 while he was out of the country.\nHe later suspected that the US had a role in his downfall and in a 1978 book, former CIA intelligence officer John Stockwell backed this theory up.\nIn In Search of Enemies he writes that an official sanction for the coup does not appear in CIA documents, but he writes \"the Accra station was nevertheless encouraged by headquarters to maintain contact with dissidents.\n\"It was given a generous budget, and maintained intimate contact with the plotters as a coup was hatched.\"\nHe says that the CIA in Ghana got more involved and its operatives were given \"unofficial credit for the eventual coup\".\nA declassified US government document does show awareness of a plot to overthrow the president, but does not indicate any official backing.\nAnother declassified document written after the coup describes Nkrumah's fall as a \"fortuitous windfall. Nkrumah was doing more to undermine our interests than any other black African\".\nIn Angola three competing groups fought for control after independence from Portugal in 1975, with the MPLA under Agostinho Neto taking over the capital Luanda.\nMr Stockwell, chief of CIA's covert operations in Angola in 1975, writes that Washington decided to oppose the MPLA, as it was seen as closer to the Soviet Union, and support the FNLA and Unita instead, even though all three had help from communist countries.\nThe CIA then helped secretly import weapons, including 30,000 rifles, through Kinshasa in neighbouring Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr Stockwell says in a video documentary.\nHe adds that CIA officers also trained fighters for armed combat.\nA declassified US government document detailing a discussion between the head of the CIA, the secretary of state and others indicates the support the CIA gave to the forces fighting the MPLA.\nThe US continued to support Unita through much of the civil war as Cuba was backing the MPLA.\nHissene Habre failed in his attempt to take power by force in Chad in 1980.\nBut his efforts led President Goukouni Oueddei to call on help from the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, whose soldiers successfully beat back Habre's challenge and forced him into exile.\nA proposed alliance between Libya and Chad began to unsettle the US especially as Gaddafi began to be seen as a supporter of anti-US activities.\nIn Foreign Policy magazine Michael Bronner writes that the CIA director, with the secretary of state, \"coalesced around the idea of launching a covert war in partnership with Habre\".\nIt is alleged that the US then backed Habre's overthrow of the president in 1982 and then supported him throughout his brutal rule.","summary":"The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a long history of involvement in African affairs, so Sunday's reports that the 1962 arrest of Nelson Mandela came following a CIA tip-off don't come as a huge surprise.","id":36303327}
{"document":"In only his second season with Porsche, Webber and his two team-mates, German Timo Bernhard and New Zealander Brendon Hartley, need a fourth-place finish or better in the 6 Hours of Bahrain on Saturday to complete a remarkable run of success for car number 17.\nWinners of the last four races, they were runners-up at the previous event in June and took third at Spa in the race before that in May.\nWebber, 39, cannot remember such a hot streak of form beyond his days in junior categories and admits he never expected to be in contention so quickly at this stage of his return to sportscars.\n\"I'm very surprised we're in this position,\" he said. \"We had a few tough races at the start of the championship and now here we are in Bahrain ready to close the championship off hopefully.\n\"It started in an incredible June where we got two cars home at Le Mans and had a 1-2 against Audi.\n\"Since then we have won every race and I don't think we envisaged that - the aggressive mentality of the F1 approach.\"\nNot surprisingly, after his 12 years at the highest level of single-seater, open-wheel competition, Webber draws heavily on his experience of fighting against the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso, the other contenders for the 2010 title at the final race of that season in Abu Dhabi.\nHe learnt the hard way on that occasion, finishing eighth behind his three rivals and third overall in the championship. This time he aims to make amends.\n\"Being a professional for so long, you have the ability to deal with the emotions and really pull it right back and just keep the basics in order, and that's what we've got to try to do,\" said Webber.\n\"Having the scenarios played out if we've got things we need to deal with - are we rehearsed, are we practised, are we ready to go?\n\"We don't want any what ifs, any 'woulda, coulda, shoulda' at 10pm on Saturday night.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWebber's challenge in 2010 was complicated by his acrimonious relationship with Red Bull team-mate Vettel.\nThe German profited most from the Australian's problems with backmarkers under the lights at Yas Marina by winning the race and the championship.\nThe team dynamic within the three-man Porsche 919 Hybrid line-up is noticeably more harmonious.\n\"You have to be super, super open with each other in terms of communication, in terms of getting the best out of each other, the little strengths and weaknesses of each other in terms of corners you like, what type of tracks you like, what type of conditions do you like and even how the car develops,\" he revealed.\n\"We've got a young bright-eyed and bushytailed youngster in Brendon Hartley, Timo Bernhard is super experienced in this category and then myself with a lot of experience.\n\"We try to make the sure the car doesn't know who's in the car, which driver is in. The car has to be very benign, so we can use it.\"\nIn his recent autobiography, Webber was critical of the way Red Bull allowed his partnership with Vettel to disintegrate following a series of incidents in 2010 and beyond.\nIt's a marked contrast to his views on his current set-up where he believes his F1 experiences have contributed to Porsche's surge to the head of the field.\n\"To put together this campaign with a great bunch of guys, I have felt pretty instrumental in it and I suppose that's as rewarding as other grand prix wins because I've had a bit more impact here in trying to help.\n\"It's a big, big team and everyone's done a great job but it's been really nice to have been able to help behind the scenes and if we can put the icing on the cake it'll be a really, really nice feather in my cap.\"\nWebber and his team-mates lead the Audi trio of Switzerland's Marcel Fassler, Germany's Andre Lotterer and France's Benoit Treluyer by 13 points.\nThey extended their advantage by an extra point on Friday after Bernhard and Hartley secured their fifth pole position of the season at the Sakhir track.\nThe circuit where the wind blows off the desert and makes tyre performance even more critical is not one of Webber's favourites.

{"document":"In the three months to June 2014, there were 960 initial decisions to place a child for adoption, compared with 1,830 in the three months to September 2013.\nThe figures were released by the Adoption Leadership Board (ALB).\nThe ALB says the drop in adoptions may have been influenced by recent court judgements in care and adoption cases.\nThe board, which was established by the government as part of a shake-up of the adoption system, said applications for court orders allowing a child to be placed for adoption had fallen by 34%.\nThere had also been a fall of 54% in the number of placement orders granted by courts, from 1,650 to 750, it said.\nIn recent years, adoption figures had risen to record levels, with an increase of 63%, the ALB said.\nBut last September, the most senior family court judge criticised the \"sloppy practice\" of social workers when bringing cases for adoption before the courts and said they were not looking closely enough at all the other options.\nPresident of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, also implied that, at a time of tight budgets, adoption may be seen as a cheaper option than helping troubled families or foster carers and warned about \"resource issues\" affecting local authorities' thinking.\nHe said there had been four cases during 10 days in July alone in which judges had expressed concerns about inadequate analysis by social services  in support of the case for adoption.\nALB chairman, Sir Martin Narey, said these court judgements had been \"entirely sensible\".\nBut he warned that they were being misinterpreted by local authorities who thought the law on adoption had changed.\nHe told the BBC that the recent drop in children being put forward for adoption was primarily due to fewer local authorities deciding adoption was the best option for a child.\n\"It's then been compounded by the refusal of some applications at the court,\" he said.\nSir Martin said some councils seemed to have taken some court rulings to mean that if a child could remain in foster care, then \"that will do\", when in fact the best interests of the child must be pursued.\nSir Martin said the drop followed two years of significant progress in finding more adoptive homes for the thousands of children waiting.\nThe number of children adopted across the UK has risen from 3,100 in 2011 to  5,050 in the last year.\nThe recent fall in children being put forward for adoption in England  has prompted  Sir Martin to issue guidance to clarify the meaning of recent court judgements.\n\"It is clear from my discussions with social workers and managers in local authorities and in voluntary adoption agencies that there is a belief that the law has been fundamentally changed by a number of court judgements.\n\"So I am pleased to produce this simple myth-busting guide - drafted by a senior queen's counsel - to what those judgements do and do not say.\n\"I am extremely grateful to Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, for his advice. He has seen the document and is supportive of its aim of dispelling the myths that have arisen.\"\nMessages included in Sir Martin's guidance reiterated that the legal test for adoption had not changed, and courts must be provided with expert, high quality, evidence-based analysis of all realistic options for a child and the arguments for and against each of these.\nSir Martin said: \"The board and I have published this guide to help everyone working for children understand the law around these complex cases, and be confident in making the right decisions for the child.\"","summary":"The number of children put forward for adoption by local councils in England has fallen by almost half in under a year, the latest figures show.","id":30002988}

A sure sign of South Africa's concerned mindset came when Pollard opted for a drop goal to re-establish their cushion.\nIn the end, the Boks had too much ball and too much power.

Real powers to boost jobs, infrastructure and investment.\n\"The easiest way to do that is to build on the existing combined authority.\n\"They have already come together to make joint decisions on transport, skills and so much more. This is a body which is ripe for more power, and ready to accept it.\"\nBut his other idea could be more contentious. He would like to see that authority led by a mayor - a kind of Boris Johnson for the North.\nHe added: \"My personal view is that we need the leader of the Combined Authority being elected as a mayor - as they have in London, New York and so many other great areas, rather than it being an appointed post as it is now.\n\"I think that is the simplest, cheapest and most sensible way to bring democracy and greater power to the combined authorities.\"\nThat's something many of those councils, and other MPs in the North East will have qualms about. And voters too possibly, as plans for a mayor in Newcastle were scrapped when people voted against the idea.\nBut Chancellor George Osborne has already indicated he's keen on mayors, and hinted he'd offer more powers to areas that adopted the model in this December's autumn statement.\nThe North East may face a tricky choice - accept a mayor or get a second-class form of devolution.\nMessrs Opperman and Wharton and other northern Conservatives will be keen to hear more on how their party plans to solve \"the English problem\" at their party's conference.\nBut voters will also be watching to see what solution a party with such a small power base in the North East comes up with for the region's particular concerns about any new UK settlement.","summary":"North East Conservatives are not an endangered species as such, but they are a select bunch, and their MPs are even thinner on the ground.","id":29385276}
{"document":"They will be able to end tenancies, sometimes without a court order, when asylum requests fail, ministers say.\nLandlords will also be required to check a migrant's status in advance of agreeing a lease. Repeat offenders could face up to five years in prison.\nBut critics have said it may lead to UK citizens being refused accommodation.\nThe proposals - to be included in the upcoming Immigration Bill - come as the British and French governments struggle to deal with a migrant crisis in Calais, where large numbers of people are making nightly bids to cross the Channel to reach the UK.\nUnder the proposals for landlords in England, the Home Office would issue a notice when an asylum application fails that confirms the tenant no longer has the right to rent property.\nAnalysis by legal correspondent Clive Coleman\nIt is currently a criminal offence to remove tenants without a court order. Obtaining that order enables bailiffs to evict tenants. That all takes time. The new measure may cut out court orders, but it is unclear:\nThis will trigger a power for landlords to end the tenancy, without a court order in some circumstances.\nLandlords will also be required to carry out \"right to rent\" checks on each tenant's immigration status before allowing them to move in, expanding a pilot that has been running for a year in the west Midlands.\nRepeatedly failing to do either would be a new offence carrying maximum penalties of five years' imprisonment or a fine.\nA blacklist of \"rogue\" landlords and letting agents will allow councils to keep track of those who have been convicted of housing offences and ban them from renting out properties if they are repeat offenders.\nCommunities Secretary Greg Clark acknowledged that cases in which tenants refused to move out would still end up in court but that the process would be quicker because landlords would have official \"evidence\" to present to the courts of their tenant's status.\n\"You have saved the landlord having to spend money establishing something that is clear and that the Home Office can provide - which is a clear statement of whether they should be there or not,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nAsked whether evicting migrants simply increased the risk of people disappearing altogether, unless immediately detained by the police, Mr Clark said the initiative was part of a \"joined-up system to send people home\".\nAnalysis, by Alicia McCarthy\nThe streets of the UK are not paved with gold. That's the clear message the government wants to send to those tempted to come to Britain illegally.\nMinisters say the tightening of the demands on private landlords in England is simply the enactment of a manifesto promise to make them carry out the same checks as employers and that migrants need to know there is no right to work or rent a home if you are in the UK illegally.\nIt's not clear yet how the scheme will work or what impact it will have other than moving illegal immigrants from where they are living.\nAnd some may suspect the timing of the announcement is a response to the nightly television news pictures showing scores of desperate migrants trying to cross the channel - and to criticism from some that ministers have failed to get a grip on the situation swiftly enough.\nFor Labour, shadow immigration minister David Hanson said he backed tougher checks but said ministers appeared to be \"offloading\" the problem on to landlords and it was up to the authorities to decide whether people should be allowed to remain or deported.\nSince August 2014, private landlords in five councils - Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham - have been required to conduct checks to establish new tenants have the right to rent in the UK or face face a penalty of up to \u00a33,000.\nMr Clark said the pilot - introduced as part of the 2014 Immigration Act - had been a success and would be extended across more of the UK, although he could not say how many people had been deported as a direct result.\nBut the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the pilot - which has yet to be officially evaluated - had serious shortcomings.\n\"We have heard that British people with foreign accents are finding it difficult to get tenancies from some of the, you might say, unscrupulous landlords,\" its chief executive Habib Rahman told Radio 4's World at One.\nAnd David Smith, from the Residential Landlords Association, said there was evidence of \"document discrimination\" with some landlords reluctant to rent their properties to anyone who could not produce a valid passport.","summary":"Landlords in England will be expected to evict tenants who lose the right to live in the UK  under new measures to clamp down on illegal immigration.","id":33754595}

{"document":"Media playback is not supported on this device\nEmotion. Drama. Excitement. Brilliant football. Noise. Colour. And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre.\nIt was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel.\nLiverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic.\nLiverpool into last four after Euro thriller\nIstanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp\nLiverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan\nWhen Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to \"turn doubters into believers\".\nAnd it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened.\nIn nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration.\nLiverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: \"Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try.\"\nAnd yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes.\nIt was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren.\nBorussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up.\nIt takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: \"We decide when it's over.\"\nThis was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do.\nIf anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left.\nThis night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop.\nBefore the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence.\nA minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions.\nIt was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere.\nSlowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken.\nKlopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night.\nTuchel said: \"When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match.\"\nKlopp added: \"It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories.\"\nThere was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night.\nIn the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed.\nAnd yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool.\nDivock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge.\nEven as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: \"We're going to have a lot of fun with this player.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEmre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team.\nIt seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer.\nAlberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of \"a win for the Liverpool country\" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals.\nOne thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield.\nMost definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp.\nSevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four.\nBut there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it.\nKlopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals.\nThe Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view.\nThe famous \"This Is Anfield\" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund.\nIt carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: \"I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big.\"\nKlopp has delivered another incentive to his Liverpool charges.","summary":"Liverpool won a game that will be talked about for generations - a Europa League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund that will live forever in the memory of all at Anfield.","id":36051192}

I couldn't watch it.\"\nSpeaking through an interpreter, the maestro said his original comments had been mis-reported, adding: \"People should pay a lot of attention when they write something down.\"\nThe pair have now collaborated for the first time, with the Italian maestro penning the soundtrack for Tarantino's upcoming film The Hateful Eight.\nIt marks the first time the composer has scored a Western since his career-defining work with Sergio Leone on films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly; and Once Upon a Time in the West.\nIt is also a first for Tarantino - who has never commissioned a full orchestral score for one of his films before, preferring to rely on old soundtracks and classic pop records.\nMorricone says it was Tarantino's dense script that persuaded him to work on the project.\n\"It was this thick,\" he says, indicating a document several times thicker than War and Peace.  \"He actually came to Rome just to convince me, to my house.\n\"It was very easy for me to say yes because the script was very, very relevant and interesting and full of detail.\"\nThe Hateful Eight, which is released in January, reunites Tarantino with several of his regular players - Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern - as well as newcomers Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir and Channing Tatum.\nSet roughly a decade after the US Civil War, it finds an eclectic group of law-keepers, outlaws, mercenaries, bounty hunters and fugitives trapped in a stagecoach waypoint by a massive snowstorm. As the plot unfurls, they begin to wonder whether they'll make it out alive.\nThe score's key movement is a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock - a piece of which Morricone is particularly proud.\n\"The main instruments introducing this piece are the bassoon, the contra-bassoon and the tuba,\" he says. \"And this is very strange because I have never done that in the past.\n\"The sound these instruments produce can express the drama, the rage, the despair and the irony that are the main themes of Tarantino's story.

It is the fourth time since November 2012 that a PCC has suspended a chief constable - something that was very rarely seen under the previous system of police authorities.\nLawyers acting on behalf of the 22 of the families welcomed the suspension.\nThe statement from Broudie Jackson Canter said: \"We hope and expect that his conduct will be subject to the rigorous and impartial scrutiny which has so long been denied to the families.\"\nDeputy Chief Constable Dawn Copley has temporarily taken over the chief role.\nIn a statement, she said she had been \"asked to act as Temporary Chief Constable\" by the PCC \"which I have agreed to do\".\n\"This is a significant day for South Yorkshire Police.\n\"However, we are absolutely determined to maintain our focus on delivering the best possible policing services to the communities of South Yorkshire,\" she added.\nIn 2012, Mr Crompton admitted \"grave errors\" were made during the Hillsborough disaster and has apologised \"profoundly\".\nOn Tuesday after the inquests conclusions were delivered, he admitted the policing of the match was \"catastrophically wrong\" and \"unequivocally\" accepted the findings.\nHours before his suspension, the force said: \"We have never sought, at any stage, to defend the failures of South Yorkshire Police or its officers.\n\"Nevertheless, these failures had to be put into the context of other contributory factors. In other words, where do the failings of SYP stand in the overall picture?\n\"We are sorry if our approach has been perceived as at odds with our earlier apology, this was certainly not our intention.\"\nHome Secretary Theresa May has praised the \"extraordinary dignity and determination\" of the Hillsborough families.\nShe said for 27 years the families and survivors \"fought for justice from the authorities that should have been trusted, and have laid blame and tried to protect themselves.\"\nThe families \"have never faltered\", she said, and commended their courage, determination and resolve.\nThe fans died as a result of a crush during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium on 15 April 1989.\nMrs May said the jury found that blunders by South Yorkshire's police and ambulance services \"caused or contributed to\" the deaths as a result of the disaster.\nThe jury also concluded that Liverpool fans were not to blame for what happened.\nShe read out the potential offences under investigation including gross negligence manslaughter, misconduct in a public office, perjury and perverting the course of justice.\nJohn Joyce, 72, who was at Sheffield Wednesday's ground on the day of the disaster, said like the families of the dead, he too wanted to see the police prosecuted.\n\"From day one they were at fault. They called us robbers, pickpockets and everything. Rubbish. They switched the statements, it's been hard. I was at the game, I was in the stands, that's why I have lived with it for 27 rotten years,\" he said.\nThe inquests jury heard more than two years of evidence at Britain's longest running inquests.\nNine jurors reached unanimous decisions on all but one of the 14 questions at the inquests into UK's worst sporting disaster.\nThe coroner Sir John Goldring said he would accept a majority decision about whether the fans were unlawfully killed - seven jurors agreed they were.","summary":"South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable David Crompton has been suspended following the Hillsborough inquests.","id":36154201}

{"document":"At first, it is hard to say exactly why. It is just that something doesn't feel quite right.  Ulsan feels like a place you vaguely know but can't quite figure out how.\nAnd then it hits you. It is reminiscent of old photographs of European shipbuilding towns on rivers whose names are redolent of their history: in Britain, the Clyde, Tyne, Wear, Tees or Mersey.\nIn those pictures cranes and partly built ships towered over houses.  Thousands streamed from work together the moment a shift ended.\nNobody could forget how work enabled their lives because they saw, heard and smelled the place of work in every corner of the town.  It was their skyline.\nThat world of the heaviest of industry is no longer prominent in Europe. Even the biggest shipyards that remain (in Romania, Poland and Germany) are minnows compared to the yards of Asia.\nIf you look at the league table of shipbuilding companies in the world, five of the top 10, including all of the top four, are South Korean. The other five are Japanese and Chinese.\nBut the Hyundai Heavy Industries yard at Ulsan is the biggest of them all, giant cranes (aptly called Goliaths) dominating the skyline. The city pulsates with work and wages and the activities of far from idle hands.\nThe yard stretches for 2.5 miles (4km).  More than 60,000 people are employed there, constructing a huge ship every four or five days. These ships are the length of three football fields and are built in pieces each weighing hundreds of tonnes and then assembled around the clock.\nIn the dark, the yard glows across the town.  By day, the clang of construction rings out.  In the old European pictures and newsreels, workers would stream home on foot or maybe bicycles.  At Ulsan, they swarm out on motor scooters.\nAnd when they are out, they drive the company car, eat in the company restaurants, laugh and cry in the company theatre, shop in the company department store, have their children in the company hospital, learn in the company schools, cheer for the company football team.\nOne of the longest-serving workers, Lee Sang-bok, told the BBC: \"Everything here is Hyundai. The highway I drive on is named after the founder of the company. The hospital and university is funded by Hyundai too.\n\"There's a town joke that it's just like the Hyundai Kingdom.\"\nHe started work at the yard soon after it opened in 1974.\n\"I joined this company when I was just 16. In the past 40 years, shipbuilding really has become the centre of my life.  I devoted all my youth to this company.  It's become my identity\".\nWhen South Korea industrialised in the 1960s and 1970s, setting in train its breathtaking transformation from poverty to affluence, it was done in a way to make Western \"free-market\" economists disapprove (though there is an argument that when the United States and Britain industrialised, they broke their own rules, too).\nGovernment direction and government subsidy was the order of the day. South Korea's leader at the time, Gen Park Chung-hee, said \"do it\" and the corrupt rich he had jailed and threatened had no choice but to create the industries the government decreed.\nIt was \"directed capitalism\".\nUnder Park Chung-hee, scores of businessmen were arrested and charged with \"illicit profiteering\".\nProperty was confiscated.  Some were paraded with signs round their necks saying:  \"I am a corrupt pig.\"\nIn return for freedom and renewed access to their money, the country's richest people were told to invest in new industries.\nThey had to sign an agreement stating:  \"I will donate all my property when the government requires it for the construction of the nation.\"\nInitially, the plan focused on six key industries (cement, synthetic fibre, electricity, fertiliser, oil refining and iron and steel), but in the early 1970s it turned to shipbuilding.\nAnd this is where construction magnate Chung Ju Yung came in.\nIt should be said that he was not in that first wave of corrupt business leaders.  He earned his money the hard way, born a peasant who left home to labour on building sites and then to form his own construction company.\nWith the Korean War, he thrived.\nInitially, he made cars in Ulsan but then turned to shipbuilding.  He was supremely ambitious and supremely confident - legend has it that he toured London seeking finance and when it was pointed out that South Korea had no shipbuilding industry, he took out a Korean bank note on which was a famous ship from the 16th Century.\nHe was also supremely careful with money.  In the company museum at the Ulsan shipyard, there are two pairs of shoes which Mr Chung is said to have worn for 30 years, getting them constantly repaired despite being a multi-billionaire.\nRead more stories from the South Korea Direct season:\nThe woman who liberated Korean housewives\nIn Pictures: Fish, fruit and veg in South Korea's markets\nHow good are Kim Jong-un's hackers?\nHis parsimony has paid off.  It used to be said that Asian manufacturers competed with Europeans and North Americans on price but not on quality.\nThat is no longer so. The Ulsan yard is a builder of sophisticated vessels into which goes a lot of top research.\nMetal gets bashed but lab mice get pushed, too.  It is heavy industry in which research and the latest technology is incorporated.\nLee Sang-bok is now an inspector at the yard.  His role is important.\nSome of the vessels built there are carriers of liquefied natural gas.  Inside these ships go huge containers.  A leak of LNG would be catastrophic, igniting a huge explosion, so welds have to be inspected in microscopic detail.  This is what Mr Lee does.\nIt is a working life that has lasted 40 years.  It has given him and his family prosperity and pride.","summary":"To a European visitor, the city of Ulsan on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula seems like a throwback to some lost world.","id":32811866}
{"document":"Reports of a \"mass murder\" investigation in France and pictures of German policemen carting bags of evidence from his parents' home suggest that officials are determined to find out.\nBut this appears to be a case of murder-suicide, which is very different and extremely rare.\nIn these incidents, one person wishing to end their life takes the lives of others - in this case, complete strangers - at the same time.\nThe statistics show that most murder-suicides happen in domestic settings, and involve a man and his spouse.\nMurder-suicides involving pilots or in gun massacres are, in fact, much, much rarer.\nWhat drives people to these acts is therefore virtually impossible to determine because there is no common theme and the perpetrators don't leave notes explaining their actions.\nIn contrast to the motivations of a suicide bomber, which are intentionally well-publicised, those behind a murder-suicide are usually more difficult to fathom.\nNo-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent.\nSimon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says it's unlikely we will ever know.\n\"It's possible something will emerge, but in most suicides people leave clues or a message.\n\"Incredibly extreme events like this are sometimes just inexplicable.\"\nDespite this, the media has been quick to point the finger at Lubitz's history of depression.\nGerman newspapers have also reported that he had received psychiatric treatment and may have been experiencing a \"personal life crisis\".\nIn reality, there is a multitude of factors, feelings and personality traits which could push someone to such an extreme course of action.\nAlcohol problems, drug misuse, broken relationships or marriages, personality disorders, work stresses - in the past or at the time of the act - can all play a part.\nMental health charities agree, and have been queuing up to plead for more understanding about depression, and less sensationalist language.\nThey say the vast majority of people with depression do not hurt anyone, and research shows that their risk is primarily to themselves.\nMarjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, says: \"There are thousands of people with a diagnosis of depression, including pilots, who work, hold positions of high responsibility and who present no danger whatsoever.\n\"We do not know what part depression played in this tragedy but it is a condition that should never be trivialised.\"\nCharities said there was a danger that mental health problems could be stigmatised by coverage of the crash, making people more afraid to talk about their experiences.\nDr Paul Keedwell, consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders, also says mental health problems are not a sufficient explanation for what happened.\n\"Among cases of murder-suicide in general, the rate of previously diagnosed depression varies from 40% to 60%, depending on the context.\"\nBut he does say that of those who are depressed, very few are being treated for it.\nIt is clear that men find it particularly difficult to seek help if they have a history of mental illness.\nIn the UK, for example, 75% of suicides are in men.\nLubitz passed the tests set by his employer which indicated he was fit to fly, but it has since come to light that he may have been hiding an illness from them.\nThis illness and his seeming inability to talk about it or come to terms with it may hold some small clue to his actions.\nBut, in reality, there is never going to be an adequate explanation for murder-suicides - particularly for the families of those killed.","summary":"The question has been raised - is 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz a mass murderer for bringing down a plane full of passengers, killing everyone on board?","id":32086196}

{"document":"Washing his own training kit and playing on sloping pitches is a world away from the life to which he had become accustomed during his career, much of which was spent in England's top two divisions.\nAs recently as March, the 32-year-old was scoring goals in the Championship in front of thousands, but on Saturday he could take to the pitch in front of hundreds as Conference South side Maidenhead host Gosport Borough in the FA Cup third qualifying round.\nBut Campbell will not be turning out for a team that plays in the sixth tier of English football because his career is on a downward spiral.\nThe former Birmingham and Queens Park Rangers player is at Maidenhead to rediscover his love for the game, having come close to retiring after being wrongly implicated in a match-fixing scandal.\nThe toughest period of his career began one December morning last year, when a knock at the door at Campbell's home preceded a dramatic arrest in front of his family, and did not end until nine months later when he was finally cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\"The whole situation was a joke and obviously depressing,\" says Campbell.\n\"It was difficult because after all I had worked for, it tarnished my name and even now you still have managers saying this and that.\n\"But I can't change any of that, all I can do is focus on getting back to where I was. Hopefully I can do that.\"\nCampbell was one of six people arrested in connection with allegations of fixing in football matches, which came after ex-Portsmouth defender Sam Sodje allegedly told an undercover newspaper reporter he could arrange yellow and red cards in exchange for cash. Sodje was later cleared.\nReleased on bail following his arrest, Campbell tried to focus on his football, but he was loaned by Blackburn to Millwall in January before leaving the Ewood Park club by mutual consent in July.\nIt was the culmination of a difficult time in Campbell's life.\nHaving climbed from non-league to the Premier League with Birmingham, QPR and Blackpool, an increasing number of injuries in recent years - coupled with the spectre of the match-fixing allegations hanging over him - almost became too much for Campbell.\n\"It was all new things to deal with and my dad passed at the same time while the match-fixing rubbish came up, so it was a lot to handle,\" he says.\n\"I got to the point where I thought 'what is the point?' I didn't need all these problems and for what?\n\"But at the same time I reflected on my career.\n\"I had done a lot to come from nothing and really make something of myself, why would I throw it all away because of this?\n\"There were plenty of people in a worse position than me who would love to play football, so I just decided to get on with it and do what I love.\"\nAfter leaving Blackburn, Campbell hired a personal trainer and took to training on his own in a park.\nIt was during that time he received a call from current Maidenhead boss Johnson Hippolyte - Campbell's friend, mentor and former manager at non-league Yeading, one of the striker's first clubs, over a decade ago.\nCampbell credits Hippolyte, \"Drax\" to those who know him, as the man who kick-started his career, having convinced him not to quit football as a teenager after being released by Aston Villa.\nConsequently, when Hippolyte made a tongue-in-cheek comment about joining Maidenhead, Campbell took it more seriously.\n\"I was waiting for the right club to come along,\" continues Campbell. \"But as time went by I thought about it more and more, and in the end thought 'why not?'\n\"The move will have surprised a lot of people but if there was anyone I was going to play for at this level it would be Drax, we have a lot of history together.\"\nThere was, though, the issue of wages. Maidenhead clearly had no chance of offering Campbell the kind of money he had been accustomed to during his Premier League and Championship days.\nBut the discussion never came up.\n\"It is not all about the money,\" Campbell says. \"It is about being happy and I have not been happy the last few years with all that has gone on.\n\"It is easy to think all footballers are motivated by money, and I could have signed for a club and just sat on the bench and taken a wage but I decided not to do that.\n\"I've decided to play for Drax and get back to doing what I love doing.\"\nHippolyte adds: \"He is not getting paid at all.\n\"The players were really keen for him to stay and play for Maidenhead when he was initially just training with us, so much so that they offered a whip-round for him.\n\"But it was never about the money for DJ, he just wants to play and enjoy himself again, and we want for him to show that he is still hungry and still has the ability.\"\nThat ability is clearly still there.\nIn front of a crowd of about 400, Campbell scored on his debut last month as Maidenhead beat Faversham Town 4-0 to progress to the FA Cup third qualifying round.\nTo grab a goal in the competition, with Hippolyte watching on from the dugout, will reignite memories of the famous FA Cup run the pair enjoyed at Yeading back in the 2004-05 season.\nCampbell scored seven goals in the competition to help Yeading reach the third round, where they lost 2-0 to Newcastle.\nBut, having held out impressively for 50 minutes against the Premier League side, with the game broadcast to millions on BBC One, Campbell caught the eye, with Brentford giving the then 24-year-old his first chance in professional football.\nFrom then on he flourished, scoring 12 goals in six months - including a double in a 2-1 win against Sunderland in the FA Cup which earned him a move to Birmingham City, then playing in the Premier League.\n\"The FA Cup really put me in the shop window,\" remembers Campbell.\n\"It made me get noticed because in those days it was tough for non-league players, not many got the chance they seem to do now.\n\"My form in the competition helped get me my move to Brentford. I continued to score lots there and Birmingham manager Steve Bruce was in the crowd when we played Sunderland in the FA Cup.\n\"I think he was looking at another player, but I scored twice and caught his eye, so that was a blessing.\"\nWith just two qualifying rounds remaining in this season's competition before the first round proper, Campbell hopes to be able to score the goals that could help Maidenhead replicate Yeading's famous FA Cup run from a decade ago.\nBut regardless of whether the Magpies can achieve that, Hippolyte, remembering the talented 16-year-old he first spotted playing in a park near his home, hopes Campbell will not be around long enough to be part of it.\n\"I really wish Saturday is his last game,\" he says.\n\"In a perfect world he will play for us, score in the FA Cup and get us through and get his move on Monday.\n\"As much as I would love to keep him here, as a father figure he should not be playing anywhere near this level.\"\nConsidering the FA Cup arguably made his career in professional football, it would only be fitting if the competition now resurrected it.","summary":"When DJ Campbell stepped out onto the Ewood Park pitch for Blackburn in October 2013, the striker - then earning a reported \u00a325,000 a week - did not expect he would be playing for free at non-league side Maidenhead United barely 12 months later.","id":29546542}

He's now in custody but people here want him released.\nHe was one of the leaders in the rebellion of 2011 when the former government was overthrown.\nElections were permitted as part of the deal to end the conflict nearly five years ago and he was chosen as village chief in a landslide.\nBut recently he had threatened to re-start the protest movement as a way of pushing yet again for these people to receive compensation for the land they say was stolen from them in the past by corrupt officials.\nYet, before he could make good with this threat, the 72 year old was taken away.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Shanwei City Chief Prosecutor Yuan Huaiyu said, following a tip off from \"someone on the internet or maybe even a villager\", Lin Zuluan was being held in custody and investigated in relation to kickbacks on several infrastructure projects including roads and a school library.\nThe prosecutor wouldn't say how much money was allegedly involved.\nHe said they have received evidence from developers giving bribes and some documents.\nAsked about the timing of Lin Zuluan's detention he said: \"We've had a preliminary investigation lasting more than three months. Possibly the timing is a coincidence but this is a judicial process and we're doing our job\".\nEven though their former leader has been shown on television in a recorded \"confession\", the villagers of Wukan think these are trumped up charges to shut down an effective campaigner.\nProsecutor Yuan says the villagers don't yet understand what their leader has done but said he expects they'll change their mind once they see the evidence.\nAsked by the BBC if there was any chance that Lin Zuluan could be released, Prosecutor Yuan laughed out loud and said: \"We need to see how this case develops\".\nThe election of Wukan's government had given people in villages right around the country great hope for what might be possible under the Chinese system as it stands today.\nWhere else could you see virtually the entire population of town or a village filling the streets in support for their Communist Party Secretary?\nEven given the risks involved - in a country where you can be thrown in jail for challenging the Party - there is a remarkable unity of purpose amongst the people of Wukan, from primary school children to elderly fishermen who each day answer the call to join in the struggle.\n\"Free Lin Zuluan!\" they chant as they march.\n\"Return our land!\"\nAnd, it's always followed by: \"Long live the Communist Party!\"\nThey're hoping that more senior political figures might override the nearby city government and come to their aid.\nIn 2011 that's exactly what happened. After expelling the officials they saw as corrupt, they barricaded the village.\nThe former Guangdong Party Chief Wang Yang brought an end to the standoff which had lasted months. He gave permission for a directly-elected government and said this would become known as \"the Wukan model\".\nWang Yang was seen as a peacemaker: a powerful party leader prepared to push for a calm and reasonable outcome as opposed to the heavy-handed tactics normally employed to crush dissent in China.\nHe appeared destined for promotion into the elite politburo standing committee. But he didn't get there.\nNow there's no Wang Yang as Guangdong party chief.\nSome analysts believe that Wukan's elections could only have happened in that unique moment in history and that the window has now closed.\nWhat's more if Lin Zuluan is prosecuted and most likely given a prison sentence it is hard to see such an open election process being allowed in order to choose his successor.\nBut the problem for Party elites trying to decide what to do with Wukan is that people here are now used to having one of their own in charge.\nThey're organised.

{"document":"Overweight children between four and 18 months old eat similar food to healthy weight children but have bigger portions, a study found.\nThe University College, London report said parents may not realise how much young children should be eating or the dangers of them being overweight.\nIt said feeding guidelines needed to be more specific and better known.\nThe study of data from a UK survey, being presented at the European Obesity Summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, looked at eating diaries parents kept for 2,564 children.\nThe diaries showed what children ate, how often they were eating and the size of their portions.\nResearchers used the data to compare the eating habits of overweight children - classed as being in the heaviest 15% in their age group - and those of a healthy weight.\nThe report found overweight children were consuming larger meals than their counterparts (141 calories versus 130 calories).\nReport author Hayley Syrad, from University College, London, said: \"The research suggests eating frequency is having no impact on weight and it's not that parents of larger children are giving them an extra Mars bar or apple - it's that their portions are bigger.\"\nFor every extra 24 calories consumed during each meal, there was a 9% increased risk of becoming overweight or obese, researchers said.\nMs Syrad said the research suggested some parents may be overfeeding their infants, potentially under the belief it is healthy for babies to be \"chubby\".\nShe added: \"We know that even birth weight tracks into later life. If children are overweight when they are under two it tracks into adulthood.\n\"A bigger baby is likely to be a bigger child and then a bigger adult.\"\nAccording to Public Health England, which publishes its advice on the NHS Choices website, there is \"very little official guidance on precisely how much food children require\".\nBut it says: \"A good rule of thumb is to start meals with small servings and let your child ask for more if they are still hungry.\n\"Try not to make your child finish everything on the plate or eat more than they want to. And avoid using adult-size plates for younger children as it encourages them to eat oversized portions.\"\nThe guidance also says children should be encouraged to eat slowly and have set mealtimes.\nJudy More, a nutritionist and paediatric dietician, said some parents were overfeeding their babies and young children out of fear of them being underfed.\nShe said babies and young children who are not overweight should eat until they are full rather than being made to finish everything on their plate.\n\"It's the parents' responsibility to provide nutritious food, but they should allow children to eat as much they want to.\"\nMs Syrad added that eating guidelines for infants and toddlers needed to be more specifically catered to smaller age ranges.\nShe said it was important for future research to follow the children in the study and see how food intake affects their weight as they get older.\nAnne-Marie O'Leary, editor-in-chief of parenting website Netmums, said more guidance and support for parents was needed.\n\"Dietary advice for adults is conflicted and confusing - the U-turn on fats, sugar becoming the bad guy - let alone for parents.\n\"When parents are weaning their babies, most of the advice is about making sure they are gaining enough weight, not about making sure they don't gain too much.\"\nShe said the website was one of the bodies consulted by the government in advance of upcoming Department of Health guidelines on childhood obesity. And one of Netmums' posts illustrating portion size for toddlers was one of its stories that generated most reader engagement.","summary":"Parents may be feeding their babies and toddlers larger portions than they need, experts have warned.","id":36444984}

{"document":"The board of ARM is expected to recommend shareholders accept the offer - which is around a 43% premium on its closing market value of \u00a316.8bn on Friday.\nThe Cambridge-based firm designs microchips used in most smartphones, including Apple's and Samsung's.\nARM, which was founded in 1990, employs more than 3,000 people.\nShares in the UK technology firm surged by 45% at the open of the London Stock Exchange to 1,742.85p per share, adding \u00a37.56bn to ARM's market value.\nARM said it would keep its headquarters in Cambridge and that it would at least double the number of its staff over the next five years.\nSoftbank is one of the world's biggest technology companies and is run by its founder, Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son.\nIt has previously acquired Vodafone's Japanese operations and the US telecoms company Sprint. The $20bn deal was the biggest foreign acquisition by a Japanese firm at the time.\nThe new deal will be funded by Softbank's own cash reserves and a long term loan from Japan's Mizuho Bank.\nIt's hard to exaggerate just how important ARM is to the UK tech sector - and the shock many are feeling this morning at the news that it is about to lose its independence.\nIts brilliance was to realise that if chips were about to come with everything, you didn't have to make them - designing them was the key.\nFive years ago, Cambridge was home to at least three world-beating UK-owned technology firms, ARM, Autonomy and Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR).\nThen Autonomy was swallowed up by HP in an ill-fated deal, last year the chipmaker Qualcomm bought CSR, and now the biggest and best, ARM, is about to have a Japanese owner.\nAnd in Softbank, ARM may well have found a good parent.\nThe Japanese firm bought France's Aldebaran robotics business and has gone on to give it a global profile.\nBut there will still be sadness this morning in Cambridge, and beyond, that Britain's best hope of building a global technology giant now appears to have gone.\nSoftbank-ARM deal is a bet on the future\nSoftbank intends to preserve the UK tech firm's organisation, including its existing senior management structure and partnership-based  business model, ARM said.\nMasayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of Softbank, said: \"This is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank's growth strategy going forward.\nHowever, the co-founder of ARM Hermann Hauser said: \"This is a sad day for me and a sad day for technology in Britain.\"\n\"ARM is the last British [technology] company that has a global reach,\" he said.\n\"It gave Britain real strength. It was a British company that determined the next generation microprocessor architecture.\"\nARM Holdings is arguably the most precious jewel in the crown of British technology, its microchip designs are used in billions of devices.\nSources close to the deal say the Japanese company considers ARM well placed to exploit the so called \"internet of things\" which may see microchips embedded in whole new categories of household and business devices.\nPrime Minister Theresa May recently questioned whether foreign takeovers of UK firms are always in the national interest. However, Softbank has committed to doubling the size of ARM's UK-based workforce over the next five years and new Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomed the deal.\nThat allure has been boosted by the fall in the value of the pound since Brexit - making UK targets cheaper and many industry watchers are predicting a new wave of foreign takeovers.\nARM has until recently argued that its future was better served as an independent company. However, Stuart Chambers, ARM chairman since March 2014, is no stranger to making it big in Japan. He was responsible for selling Pilkington, another blue chip UK company, to Nippon Sheet Glass in 2006.\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the deal between Softbank and ARM Holdings showed the UK economy could be successful after the country voted to leave the European Union.\nA spokeswoman for the prime minister said Mrs May believed the deal was in the country's national interest - a gauge that she will use to assess any future foreign takeovers.\n\"This is good news for British workers, it's good news for the British economy, it shows that, as the prime minister has been saying, we can make a success of leaving the EU,\" the spokeswoman added.\nDan Ridsdale, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said \"An increase in inbound merger and acquisition activity was one of the obvious consequences of Brexit and weakened sterling, but few expected it to manifest itself so quickly or at so large a scale.\"\nFormer Business Secretary Vince Cable told the BBC there was usually very little the government could do to prevent takeovers.\n\"We don't have a system of defence against takeovers if they prove to be unsatisfactory,\" he said.\nMr Cable added the government had few legal powers to stop takeovers unless it could be demonstrated there was a national security issue.","summary":"UK technology firm ARM Holdings is to be bought by Japan's Softbank for \u00a324bn ($32bn) it confirmed on Monday.","id":36822806}

But I hope so!\" she says.\nThe 21-year-old joined the team in the B2 (or partially sighted) category but a deterioration in her vision means she's moved to B1, the category for blind players.\n\"When I started, I could see the ball a little bit, now it's a bit more challenging,\" she says.\nBut the friendly, banter-filled atmosphere makes playing less daunting.\n\"When you're out there, you have to have confidence in yourself.\n\"Some totally blind people that have just started to play are afraid to run around without a guide, but the coach and other team members are like 'Go for it! Chase the ball!' so that helps.\"\nOne of four female players on the team, Trinidad is determined to reach the top.\n\"I've heard that they're going to have a female [blind cricket] West Indies team from next year,\" she says excitedly.\nGiven that the West Indies recently won its first Women's World Twenty20 in April, the timing could not be better.\nTrinidad is not the only one to wax lyrical about the game and its off-pitch benefits.\n\"Blind cricket basically helped me to transform my life from being someone who was isolated from society, lacked self-esteem and confidence, to someone that is fully empowered,\" enthuses Singh.\nIn 2006, he and two other Guyanese cricketers, Oliver Kerr and Patrick Dillon, were part of the first West Indies team to participate in the Blind Cricket World Cup, held in Pakistan.\nThough perhaps Singh's success is no surprise, given that the village where he hails from, Unity, also produced Shivnarine Chanderpaul, former captain of the West Indies cricket team, and women's cricketer Indomatie Goordyal.\nWith another Blind Cricket World Cup set to take place in India in January 2017, the team are hoping to do well at this weekend's regional T20 championships.\nCoach Bharat Mangru is confident.\n\"This is the first season that we've had a full compliment of B3 players [those with better vision]. They're young, energetic and that feeds the other players.\n\"Over the years we went out there to compete. But I think this year our message is: Win.\"\nOne potential roadblock to success is the lack of stable financial support.\n\"Prior to a tournament or any time we need funding, we start writing letters soliciting funding from private sector and government agencies. But it's not reliable,\" says Singh.\nFor the forthcoming trip to Trinidad, they are about $1,500 (\u00c2\u00a31,150) short.\n\"But we're hoping that we can get it. We're always optimistic,\" says Singh.\nYet just as they refuse to let a little rain get in the way of their practice, the team are determined to play on.\nCoach Mangru is not surprised.\n\"In sighted cricket, the first thing some of the guys would have said is, 'Ah Coach, man! It's raining. We got to come to the ground?' But these guys called me at home from the stadium.\n\"That's the kind of commitment there is.\"","summary":"It is a drizzly Sunday morning in Guyana, and at the National Stadium a game of cricket is in full swing.","id":36734108}

{"document":"The government has confirmed that the communications infrastructure which links smart meters to energy suppliers will now not be ready until the autumn.\nThe system was due to be switched on on Wednesday.\nThe government says the system, which automatically sends meter readings to energy suppliers, is now due to go live at the end of September.\nThe government wants every home and business to be offered a smart meter by the end of 2020. That requires 53 million meters to be fitted in over 30 million premises over the next four years.\nThe meters will measure gas and electricity use and automatically send meter readings to energy suppliers, ending manual meter readings.\nA new body, the Data and Communications Company (DCC), was set up to create the infrastructure to handle all that information.\nBut the huge IT project has suffered a series of delays, much to the dissatisfaction of public assistance service Citizens Advice.\n\"Smart meters can transform the way people use and pay for their energy,\" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.\n\"This is now the third time in 18 months that this IT project has been pushed back and we are concerned that the delay to this important communications system will make it harder to meet the 2020 deadline for the roll-out of smart meters.\n\"This could make the overall project more expensive and hit consumers with higher bills down the line.\n\"It's crucial that the government is clear on whether the compressed timetable for installation will result in additional costs to consumers,\" said Ms Guy.\nIt was originally expected to be operational in 2015. That was put back a year until April 2016 and then further delayed until this August.\nAs recently as last month, the government told the BBC that the DCC would go live on 17 August.\nBut the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) now says that has been delayed until next month at the earliest.\nA BEIS spokesperson said: \"The new infrastructure is planned to go live at the end of September, it is currently being tested to deliver a long-lasting, world class system to bill payers.\"\nMany in the industry had expected the switch-on of the DCC to be put back.\nBut confirmation of the delay was met with exasperation by an insider at one of the big six energy suppliers.\nSMART METER COSTS\nDCC cost \u00a32.47bn\nTotal roll-out cost \u00a310.9bn\nTotal benefits \u00a317bn\nNet Benefits \u00a36.2bn\nSource: Government\/DECC 2014 impact assessment\n\"It's yet another delay in what's been a drawn out and badly managed project that we are rapidly losing confidence in,\" he said.\nAnother industry executive told the BBC that there was increasing dissatisfaction with how the programme had been handled.\n\"It's got to be done - we've sunk so many millions into it,\" he said. \"But how good will it be and how reliable will it be?\"\nHe also thinks the 2020 roll-out deadline is looking increasingly unlikely.\n\"I don't think anyone seriously thinks that is a realistic proposition,\" he said.\nDan Lewis, senior adviser on infrastructure policy at the Institute of Directors, thinks the delay is an opportunity to look at whether the benefits of smart meters outweigh the cost of the roll-out.\n\"I lost count of the delays to the smart meter programme some time ago,\" he said.\n\"Now more than ever, the new government must assert some leadership over the programme and publish the long overdue impact assessment. It will almost certainly find that in a world of much lower energy prices and endless programme delays, the benefits to consumers are now much lower and the costs substantially higher.\"\nThe government insists that the delay won't hold up the roll-out of smart meters. Some 3.6 million have been installed to date in homes and businesses across Britain.\nBut this latest setback has consequences for any of those households that want to move to a cheaper supplier as they will lose the smart functionality if they switch.\nWhen the DCC system is operating, that will no longer happen. So its a crucial building block of the roll-out programme.\nThe DCC body is a wholly owned subsidiary of Capita, the outsourcing and business services firm.\nWhile the cause of the latest delay remains unclear a spokesperson for DCC said: \"As indicated by the Department, the timetable for the roll-out of the new infrastructure will allow for testing of the system to ensure that it will deliver a long-lasting and effective system.\"\nYou can follow John at @JohnMoylanBBC","summary":"A key IT project at the heart of the UK's national smart meter roll-out programme is facing further delays.","id":37102725}

{"document":"Brad McKay crouched to volley in Greg Tansey's deep free-kick early in the match.\nAnd Tansey converted a penalty after Massimo Donati had fouled Ross Draper.\nAccies were upset Ali Crawford was not awarded a second-half spot-kick for a challenge by goalkeeper Ryan Esson but netted late on through Danny Redmond.\nThe gap between Caley Thistle and Motherwell also stands at four points, with Well behind Hamilton on goal difference after losing to Ross County.\nThe first-half performance was exactly what Inverness manager Richie Foran has been searching for and came with their backs planted firmly against the wall.\nThey were terrific. Adversity sometimes brings out the best in people, although nerves did seem to take effect after half-time.\nForan has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going. They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns, at least temporarily, to sides above.\nTansey, who has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen, was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory. It was his delivery that found McKay ghosting in and the defender's finish was perfect.\nAnother Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground. Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure.\nIn truth, Inverness could have been out of sight by the break.\nBilly Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey's drive.\nAnd, in the second period, Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but dinked over.\nMartin Canning's side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rakish Bingham.\nAnd Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline. As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out, Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down.\nReferee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot, leaving Hamilton players in disbelief. It was a huge escape for the home side.\nHaving offered little earlier in the match, other than a great chance for Darian MacKinnon which he prodded wide, the second-half response was firm.\nDougie Imrie, Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence.\nRedmond's late finish was little consolation, although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides.\nMatch ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.\nSecond Half ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.\nGoal!

{"document":"Sergei Lavrov said the US had broken its promise to separate the powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front) and other extremist groups from more moderate rebels.\nAnd he defended the bombardment of Aleppo by Russian and Syrian forces.\nJabhat Fateh al-Sham is linked to al-Qaeda.\nMr Lavrov was speaking to Stephen Sackur on BBC World News TV on the first anniversary of the beginning of the Russian air campaign in Syria.\n\"They [the US] pledged solemnly to take as a priority an obligation to separate the opposition from Nusra,\" he said.\n\"They still, in spite of many repeated promises and commitments... are not able or not willing to do this and we have more and more reasons to believe that from the very beginning the plan was to spare Nusra and to keep it just in case for Plan B or stage two when it would be time to change the regime.\"\nWatch the BBC interview in full.\nMr Lavrov says that it is US policy towards Syria that is floundering, insisting that  American officials have lost control of both events and of themselves.\nThere is an element of truth here - at least in policy terms. The US has no real alternative to Secretary of State John Kerry's efforts to deal with the Russians. There is no credible \"plan B\".\nMr Lavrov's central message - that Washington has refused to press its allies to separate themselves from the Islamists of al-Nusra ignores the fact that it is Russia's air campaign that is pushing rebel groups into al-Nusra's arms. Mr Lavrov's contention that the US is preserving al-Nusra,  hoping eventually to use it to change the regime, will prompt  gasps of condemnation in Washington.\nBut Mr Lavrov implicitly highlights a perennial difficulty for Washington - its search  for a moderate opposition of sufficient critical mass to influence the battlefield.\nWho are Jabhat Fateh al-Sham?\nHow Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Syria campaign has paid off\nAleppo remains thorn in government's side\nWhy truce was doomed to fail\nA recent US-Russian deal was meant to lead to joint Russian-US air strikes on the Islamic State group and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.\nBut many of the more moderate rebel groups that the US backs have formed a strategic alliance with the more powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and now fight alongside it.\nMr Lavrov said: \"We believe that the Russian-American deal must be put into effect. For this the only thing which is necessary is to separate the opposition from Nusra. If it is supported by the United States, not on paper but in real life, and then we will insist on an immediate cessation of hostilities.\"\nThe United Nations says 400 civilians, including many children, have been killed in the besieged city of Aleppo during the past week as a result of bombardment by Russian and Syrian government forces.\nMr Lavrov insisted Russia was helping President Assad's forces to \"fight terrorists\".\nAnd he accused the West of staying quiet about civilian suffering in Aleppo when it was expecting the city to fall to the rebels after the Nusra group moved in and cut supply lines to the civilian population.\n\"We had many pauses, many humanitarian pauses during this year... 48 hours, 72 hours at the request of the United Nations.\n\"Every time these pauses have been used by Nusra to get from abroad more fighters, more ammunition and more weapons. There must be some first step and we have to get our priorities right.\n\"Humanitarian things are very important and we are doing everything now together with the Syrian government to help the United Nations to get weekly pauses in Aleppo to deliver humanitarian goods. It's the Nusra-controlled people in eastern Aleppo who refuse to do this.\"\nPressed on the civilian casualties in Aleppo allegedly caused by Russian bunker-busting bombs, phosphorus munitions and cluster bombs, he replied: \"If this happens, then we are very sorry.\"\nBut he insisted there had been no \"meaningful proof\" of this and there was a need to investigate every case.\n\"We are not using any munition which is prohibited by the United Nations,\" he added.\nFriday saw Syrian government forces and rebels fighting in the centre of Aleppo and north of the city, a week into the Russian-backed offensive by the Syrian army to take the city and surrounding area.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group and a Syrian military official said government forces had captured territory north of Aleppo and buildings in the city centre, but rebel sources denied this.","summary":"The US is trying to spare a jihadist group in its attempts to unseat Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Russia's foreign minister has told the BBC.","id":37520793}

One stark reminder of the reality faced by far too many bullied young people is that 27% of LGBT children have attempted suicide.\n\"But we have also heard of some inspiring and great practice going on around Scotland - and there are schools where bullying is now seen as not cool.\n\"We are trying to bottle that attitude change and roll it out across the whole country.\"\nSusie McGuinness, a 19-year-old Glasgow University student, told her story of bullying and classroom harassment to MSPs while they were taking evidence for the report.\nShe said: \"I know from my own experience that there are instances of girls who have been filmed being assaulted, and that there is footage of rape going around schools and not being reported or dealt with.\n\"People need to realise that sexual harassment and bullying of this nature is happening to girls aged 12 or 13.

{"document":"For decades, large numbers of Haitians have migrated - many of them without papers - to the Dominican Republic, to escape the poverty and lack of employment in their homeland.\nIn 2013, the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled that children born there to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality.\nAn 18-month period followed in which undocumented migrants were asked to \"regulate their status\".\nThousands who did not meet the deadline left the Dominican Republic, with many saying they were forced out by the authorities.\nAs the BBC's Will Grant found, the Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticised for promoting what activists describe as a policy of division.\nWeekly Mass at Parc Cadeau is a simple affair.\nThe church is a small hut made of wicker and palm, the congregation spread out over a few wooden benches.\nLooking around the camp, one of several along Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic, you might think that the parishioners have little to be thankful for.\nIt is surely one of the poorest places in Latin America.\nA year ago thousands of returning Haitians arrived at Parc Cadeau.\nSome had been forcibly deported from the Dominican Republic, others left voluntarily to avoid confrontation with the authorities.\nToday hundreds of families remain on the dusty ranch, living in hastily erected shacks of plastic sheeting, cardboard and rope, trapped in near stateless limbo.\nSoinicier Giles is typical of many in the camp.\nHe spent 22 years living as a farmer in the Dominican Republic, before being deported last year.\nHe takes me to a ramshackle hut to meet his wife Eleny and six of their eight children. The other two were left behind when he was deported.\nThe conditions are extremely harsh, especially for the youngest. \"We sleep directly on the floor and it gets wet inside when it rains,\" Eleny explains.\nThe children were all born in the Dominican Republic itself.\nThey are showing signs of malnutrition and have developed a skin condition since arriving at the camp.\n\"They're very hungry, we all are, because we can only afford one meal a day,\" she says in Creole-accented Spanish.\nOne of the few local figures helping the returnees is the parish priest, Father Luc Leandre.\nWith funds from the International Organisation for Migration, he has helped relocate some of the most desperate families to nearby communities in Haiti.\n\"It's a grave crisis, very, very bad,\" Father Leandre tells me.\n\"The Church is like a mother for everyone and I have a duty to help. Not only that, the Pope told everyone they have to help the refugees wherever they are.\"\nBut Father Leandre says the attitude of some conservative priests on the other side of the border, particularly in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, has complicated his work.\n\"The cardinal in Santo Domingo is personally very vocal in his support for the deportations. He supported sending all the Haitians back to their country.\"\n\"It's racism,\" he laments, saying the law specifically targeted black Haitians, a charge denied by lawmakers in the Dominican Republic.\nThe priest Father Leandre was referring to has been the most influential voice in the Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic for almost 40 years: the controversial and outspoken Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez.\nEarlier this month, Pope Francis accepted the cardinal's resignation, which all archbishops are obliged to offer once they reach the age of 75.\nBut he will remain an important figure in the Church and in Dominican public life.\nThe BBC repeatedly requested an interview with Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus so he could respond to the criticisms against him but both he and his press secretary declined.\nIn many ways, the Haitian migrant crisis has exposed greater divisions within the Catholic Church in Hispaniola over where it should position itself in the 21st Century.\nPope Francis - both the first Jesuit pope and the first from Latin America - designated 2016 as the \"Year of Mercy\" and certainly Jesuits have been instrumental in supporting the Haitian returnees.\nIn a video that went viral, the cardinal was filmed in a furious diatribe about a Jesuit priest called Mario Serrano calling him \"shameless\" and a \"leftist\".\n\"He's not very accustomed to being publically confronted,\" Mario Serrano tells me from the northern border region of Dajabon, where he works with undocumented Haitians.\n\"I just said that (his) kind of speech was not according to the Catholic teaching and was not for a priest or a Christian.\n\"I think that really made him mad.\"\nSupporters of the new regularisation law, such as the former Dominican ambassador to the US, Flavio Espinal, deny that the legislation was either cruel or motivated by racism.\n\"Nothing's perfect and the process here has not been perfect. Yet this has been an extraordinary step forward in the direction of regularising close to 300,000 people who were undocumented in this country.\n\"That's not an easy decision to make nowadays.\"\nAt night, to avoid detection, the farmer Soinicier Giles leaves Parc Cadeau and slips back into the Dominican Republic, the border marked by the Pedernales River.\nThere he strips the trees for firewood to make charcoal, to sell to Dominican traders for a few dollars.\nHe knows the practice damages the fertility of the soil, but it's the only available source of income.\n\"This is the only way we can survive,\" he says, motioning at his family, stuck inside the world's forgotten migrant crisis.\nYou can hear more of Will Grant's report on Heart and Soul on the BBC World Service.","summary":"Immigration has long been a divisive issue on Hispaniola, the Caribbean island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.","id":36896016}

{"document":"It involves candidates hoping to become the world's most prominent diplomat.\nAt the stroke of midnight on 31 December, as the glitter ball in Times Square makes its annual descent, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is due to end his term in office.\nThe manoeuvring to succeed him - at present it is too genteel to describe it as a fight - is now moving into higher gear.\nJust as Campaign 2016 could end up with the election of the first female US president, there's a strong possibility that the next head of the UN will become the organisation's first female secretary-general.\nThis week, for the first time in the 70-year history of the UN, the declared candidates will take part in public hustings.\nThis is a radical departure for an organisation that rivals the Vatican in the shadowy secrecy of its executive recruitment process, with its monochrome backrooms hosting the UN equivalent of the papal conclave in the Sistine Chapel.\nThose who have so far put their names forward, half of them women, will face two hours of questioning from member states.\nTo support their applications, they've also been asked to post their curricula vitae online and to compose a 2,000-word vision statement articulating how they would run an organisation with 30 separate agencies, funds and programmes and 40,000 staff, not to mention 193 member states.\nWhat has long been a ridiculously closeted and opaque process is being made more inclusive and transparent. The aim is to turn it into something bearing at least some resemblance to a regular interview process, a far cry from the stealth selection procedure that produced Mr Ban.\nWhen the South Korean was jockeying for the job, he shied away from campaigning inside the UN headquarters he would soon end up running.\nEight candidates have so far declared and most are from Eastern Europe. Under an unwritten rule of regional rotation, a diplomatic version of \"Buggins' turn\", this geographical bloc is next in line to fill the vacancy.\nTo a global audience, most of the candidates are \"need-to-Google\" figures.\nTop row (from left):\nBottom row (from left):\nMore information on the candidates and the selection procedure is available on the UN's website\nThe field is expected to grow. Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian who is a vice-president of the European Commission, might yet be persuaded to run and may well be Mr Ban's preferred choice.\nIn a move that boosted her UN profile, he selected the former World Bank official to co-chair a panel looking into the funding of humanitarian aid.\nHowever, the Bulgarian government is backing Ms Bokova, who heads the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), and Ms Georgieva herself has indicated that she intends to pay \"full attention\" for the time being to her EU responsibilities.\nKevin Rudd, the former Australian Prime Minister, has long made the UN secretary-general's job the target of his immense personal ambition.\nThen there is the wild card. Many diplomats would like to see German Chancellor Angela Merkel throw her giant-sized hat in the ring.\nMore of a general than a secretary, Mrs Merkel is precisely the kind of big hitter that many UN watchers believe the organisation desperately needs after the more timid leadership style of Mr Ban.\nFor all the attempts to modernise the process it could never be described as democratic. Nowhere near.\nUnder the selection procedure, the 15-member Security Council recommends a single candidate for the 193-member General Assembly to essentially rubber stamp.\nThus, the power still resides with the permanent five members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia, the UK and US - which can all veto candidates. The US, for instance, vetoed Boutros Boutros-Ghali, when the Egyptian sought a second five-year term.\nThough the hustings may be held in public, the next UN secretary-general will be the candidate who emerges from backroom bargaining, mainly involving the US and Russia.\nWhat's more important than the candidates' CVs, then, is whether at any stage of their careers they have displeased the permanent \"P5\" members.\nThis is a headache for Ms Bokova, who as head of Unesco, admitted the Palestinians into the organisation, against the express wishes of the US, which retaliated by cutting off funding.\nShe is also seen as Moscow's preferred choice, which means the US is almost certain to block her. As for her fellow Bulgarian, Ms Georgieva could pay a price for the EU's sanctions against Russia. Others fail what's been called the \"testicular test\".\nDespite the new-found openness of the process, UN reformers had been lobbying for more sweeping changes to the selection process.\nThe 1 for 7 Billion campaign, an umbrella group bringing together NGOs from all over the world, has urged the Security Council to recommend two candidates to the General Assembly, something the P5 veto-wielders would never sanction.\nThey would also prefer to see the new secretary-general appointed to a single seven-year term, rather than the present practice of serving two five-year terms. Again, that will not happen.\nSo despite calls for a strong figurehead for the UN - that general rather than secretary idea - the present system means that compromise candidates inevitably emerge, who are not necessarily the most able but the least objectionable to the P5 countries.\nRather than a big name, the UN could easily end up with a leader little known outside diplomatic circles, a new secretary-general whom most of the world will have to Google.","summary":"As the hoopla of the presidential campaign comes to New York, featuring the political all-stars seeking to become the world's most powerful leader, another race is also under way in the city - a contest of the largely obscure.","id":35997985}

{"document":"\"I know that the presidential campaign is developing actively in France,\" the Russian president said, adding: \"Of course, we do not want to influence events in any way.\"\nThe Russian president appeared to be suppressing a grin as he spoke those words. Marine Le Pen appeared unperturbed.\nShe repeated her support for Moscow's annexation of Crimea, and her opposition to the sanctions subsequently imposed by the EU. If elected to the Elysee Palace, she pledged: \"I would envisage lifting the sanctions quite quickly.\"\nSo the meeting was a win for both. Madame Le Pen looked like a world-leader-in-waiting; Mr Putin received assurances from a woman who might become president of France, and who, like him, opposes the EU and Nato.\nBut there is more to the relationship between Mr Putin and Ms Le Pen than ideological convergence. Because of the National Front's racist and anti-Semitic past, French banks have declined to lend the party money.\nSo Marine Le Pen has been forced to look elsewhere for financing.\nIn 2014, the National Front took Russian loans worth \u20ac11m (\u00a39.4m). One of the loans, for \u20ac9m, came from a small bank, First Czech Russian Bank, with links to the Kremlin.\nThe loan was brokered by Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, an energy consultant turned MEP, who has called himself \"Mr Mission Impossible\".\nWhen I met him in Strasbourg, he told me he initially secured an agreement with a financial institution in Abu Dhabi, but the deal fell through. He even approached a potential lender in Iran, but Marine Le Pen vetoed the idea, he said. Eventually, he went to Russia.\nThe negotiations over the loan coincided with Russia's annexation of Crimea. EU governments condemned the annexation. Marine Le Pen publicly took the opposite view, leading some to question whether the loans were a quid-pro-quo.\nMr Schaffhauser denied he and Ms Le Pen ever discussed the issue of Crimea in relation to the loan.\n\"Always Marine Le Pen, and Jean-Marie before, was for co-operation with Russia,\" he said. \"It was not a political loan.  It was a commercial loan.\"\nBut Russia did want to use Ms Le Pen to legitimise its actions in Crimea. We know this because a group of Russian hackers, known as Shaltai Boltai, or Humpty Dumpty, published a series of text messages said to be between a Kremlin official and a Russian MP.\nThe exchanges, which took place in mid-March 2014, shows the pair discussing the possibility of Marine Le Pen travelling to Crimea as an observer in the referendum which would lead to Crimea's annexation.\n\"We really need this, I told my boss you were in contact with her,\" the Kremlin official says.\nMarine Le Pen didn't go to Crimea. Instead she publicly backed the results of the referendum, a fact that delighted the Kremlin official and the MP.\n\"She didn't let us down,\" says one text, followed by a smiley-face.\n\"We must find some way of demonstrating our respect to the French,\" comes the reply.\nSome believe the \u20ac9m loan, which was made later that year, was indeed a reward for Ms Le Pen's support over Crimea.\n\"For me, there is no doubt that [the loan] was authorised by Kremlin,\" said Mikhail Kasyanov, who was prime minister under Vladimir Putin before he joined the opposition.\n\"[It was] a special operation, a special recommendation of those businesspeople, to help Marine Le Pen.\"\nLong read: The story of Marine Le Pen\nIs Russia really interfering in European states?\nFrance's election: Who are the candidates?\nThe Kremlin told me it had nothing to do with the loans, and that Mr Putin and Marine Le Pen had never met before the visit to Moscow in March 2017. Marine Le Pen echoed that.\nBut I heard something different, and from a pretty good source.\nIn February, I met Marine's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the National Front, at his mansion on the outskirts of Paris. On his desk, he showed me a glossy calendar depicting Vladimir Putin in various military poses.\n\"I see, that's your friend,\" I joked.\n\"He's not my friend,\" he said, \"I've never met him. But he's met Marine.\"\nMr Le Pen was unclear about the exact details of the meeting. But this conversation took place before the public meeting in the Kremlin in March.\nJean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter are not on good terms. She expelled him from the National Front in 2015 in an attempt to distance herself from his racist, anti-Semitic reputation.\nBut other people close to Marine Le Pen also told me that she had claimed to have met Mr Putin previously. Somebody is lying. But who? And why?\nWhen I asked Jean-Luc Schaffhauser about the earlier meeting he said simply:\n\"This is a secret. There are little secrets, and this secret.\"\nMarine Le Pen maintains she has never been influenced by Russian money. But last week it was revealed the National Front had applied for another Russian loan in 2016.\nAmid fears over Russian interference in elections from Europe to the United States, the mystery of her relationship with Vladimir Putin casts a shadow over her campaign.\nMarine Le Pen: Who's Funding France's Far Right? is on BBC One at 20:30, Monday, April 3.

Burkina Faso's presidential guard has become addicted to power and that economies wrecked by Ebola cannot do without international assistance.\nWorld leaders have now agreed on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which replace the Millennium Goals, and feature many of the issues that the 20th Century grappled with.\nFarai Sevenzo:\n\"From rising prices, to lack of pasture for cattle to drought and floods - food and hunger remain the continent's major worry\"\nBut paramount amongst the 17 SDGs is the struggle to end hunger.\n\"While the number of people suffering from hunger in developing regions has fallen by half since 1990, there are still close to 800 million people undernourished worldwide, a majority children and youth,\" said Mogens Lykketoft, president of the 70th session of the UN General Assembly.\nOf course hunger has not arrived unannounced, the state of the planet and the effects of global warming have been playing havoc with people's crops all over southern Africa.\nMalawi, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has warned, faces its worst food crisis in 10 years.\nThe WFP says 2.8 million people are at risk and that an astonishing four out of every 10 Malawian children are suffering from stunted growth.\nPoor rainfall affected the crops in 2013\/2014 and then floods compounded the problem in early 2015 by destroying homes and wiping out food supplies.\nUSAid's Famine Early Warning System has also listed food shortages in Ethiopia and Somalia, as well as in Sierra Leone and Liberia following the outbreak of Ebola.\nFrom rising prices, to lack of pasture for cattle to drought and floods - food and hunger remain the continent's major worry.\nThose attending the Sustainable Goals event spoke of its wide scope; UN chief Ban Ki-Moon said the new development blueprint was designed to \"resonate with people across the world\", while  UN Development Programme head Helen Clark said the goals called \"for a paradigm shift in how the international society understands development\".\nDevelopment, if truth be told, has sometimes been hampered by some of the very people who gather every September in the autumn sunshine.\nBut it is their solemn duty - and ours - to try and develop ourselves.\nAt its worst, the UN is a grey monolithic beast that is overstaffed with career diplomats and \"angels of mercy\" who run around African cities in their 4x4s on behalf of Western charities and their own ambitious career paths.\nBut at its best, the UN is the last refuge for the powerless, the hungry and the needy.\nAnd Africa has far too many people in all three categories to do without it.","summary":"In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo considers why the UN matters to Africa.","id":34402415}

{"document":"The Republican nominee denied ever sexually assaulting women, but turned his fire on ex-President Bill Clinton in a bitter US presidential debate.\n\"There's never been anybody in the history of politics that has been so abusive to women,\" he said.\nHillary Clinton refused to address his comments about her husband.\nMr Trump's attack on the Clintons came after moderator Anderson Cooper asked him about a 2005 video released on Friday that revealed Mr Trump bragging about groping women.\nThe 70-year-old billionaire dismissed the remarks as \"just words\" and \"locker room talk\".\nWhen pressed on whether he had engaged in sexual misconduct, he denied doing so and instead focused on Mr Clinton's previous indiscretions.\nNo criminal charges have been brought against Mr Clinton in any allegations of sexual assault.\nMrs Clinton said the explosive video, which has sparked an exodus of Republicans denying support to their presidential nominee, \"represents exactly who he is\".\n\"With prior Republican nominees, I disagreed with them,\" she added, \"but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\nWhen the two took to the stage in St Louis for their second of three debates, they did not shake hands, striking a bitter tone that would continue throughout.\nMr Trump said if he won, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton and she would be in prison over her private email arrangements.\n\"Everything he just said is absolutely false but I'm not surprised,\" she responded. \"It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\"\n\"Because you'd be in jail,\" he interrupted.\nMr Trump also said his Democratic rival \"has tremendous hate in her heart\" while criticising her for referring to his supporters as \"deplorables\".\nMrs Clinton said she apologised for the comment, adding: \"My argument is not with his supporters, it's with him, about the hateful and divisive campaign he has run.\"\nThe two also sparred on the conflict in Syria, Russian aggression, Trump's refusal to release his tax returns and his plan for the \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants arriving from countries with links to terrorism.\nThe evening concluded when an audience member asked the candidates to say one positive thing about each other.\nMrs Clinton said his children were a great reflection of him while Mr Trump called his opponent \"a fighter\" who never gives up.\nAn hour before the debate began, Mr Trump appeared at a news conference with women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.\nHe joined three women who allege the former president sexually assaulted them and called the women \"very courageous\".\nThe Republican was under immense pressure after making obscene comments about women in the video.\nAt least 33 senior Republicans - including senators, members of Congress, and state governors - have withdrawn their support since the video surfaced on Friday.\nDonald Trump entered this debate threatening to unload every bit of malicious allegations and rumours on Hillary Clinton. And he did.\nAccusations of Bill Clinton's sexual impropriety? Check. Her work as a public defender representing a rapist? Yup. He even tied it up in a bow by remarking that his Democratic opponent should be in jail.\nMrs Clinton said she would take the high road, but she did get in her shots as well, saying the illicit video of Mr Trump's lewd comments showed who he really is.\nAnd then, after that nuclear exchange, the debate chugged along - with Mr Trump often gaining the upper hand. If his weakness is policy knowledge, there were few opportunities where his shortcoming were exposed.\nInstead, there was plenty of time for Mrs Clinton to offer a yet another muddled answer on her email server and essentially confirm that the Wikileaks hacked speech excerpts are accurate. Mr Trump offered word salads in answers about healthcare reform and Syria policy. If anything, from there the debate was a draw.\nWith Mrs Clinton ahead right now, a draw will probably suit her just fine. But it wasn't the knock-out blow her supporters probably hoped for.\nWho won the debate?\nMrs Clinton also defended controversial remarks she made in a private speech that was made public in leaked emails on Saturday.\nThe transcript had revealed she said a politician has a public and private position, but at the debate she said she had watched a film about Abraham Lincoln and was referring only to what he had done.\nClinton's Wall Street speeches leaked\nMr Trump appeared with Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who settled a sexual harassment suit against Mr Clinton for $850,000 in 1999 with no admission of guilt.\nJuanita Broaddrick, who claimed Mr Clinton raped her in a hotel room in 1978, also appeared with Mr Trump.\nMr Clinton has denied the claim through his lawyer and no charges have ever been brought against him.\nThe third woman was Kathleen Willey, a former White House aide who said Mr Clinton groped her in his office in 1993, but had previously said it never happened.\nMr Clinton has also denied this claim.\nKatty Kay:\nKathy Shelton, a fourth woman who spoke, encountered Mrs Clinton in a criminal case when she was 12 years old.\nEarly in Mrs Clinton's legal career, she was appointed to defend Ms Shelton's rapist, despite objections, and had his sentence reduced to a lesser charge.\nYears later, an audio tape emerged of Mrs Clinton speaking with a reporter, in which she can be heard laughing about the case.\nDuring one instance, she laughed after explaining that her client had passed a lie detector test, which convinced her to never trust them again.\nHow does the US election work?\nA-Z guide to political jargon\nKey issues - where candidates stand\nWhy this election will make history","summary":"Donald Trump has responded to an outcry over his remarks about groping women by launching a blistering attack against Hillary Clinton and her husband.","id":37604151}
{"document":"The imagery, released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor and taken on 31 October, shows how almost all the buildings at the airport, on the southern outskirts of Mosul, have been razed.\nRunways have also been damaged, with wide trenches carved into them and rubble placed along their lengths, Stratfor's analysis says. Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged.\nAbout 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants.\nGovernment forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts.\nThe damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles.\nHowever, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says.\nIS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July.\nBy comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair.\nMirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport.\nStratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport.\nAlong with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base.\nIn contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS.\nAfter the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them.\nHowever, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings.\nSatellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.","summary":"Satellite images of Mosul have revealed how fighters from so-called Islamic State (IS) have destroyed much of the city's airport to render it unusable as Iraqi forces close in.","id":37936530}
{"document":"Marie Black, 34, of Norwich, stood trial with nine others, including five women, at Norwich Crown Court.\nBlack denied 26 charges. A jury found her guilty of all but three counts.\nShe was convicted of offences including rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Two men were found guilty of child sex abuse and another woman was found guilty of assault.\nMichael Rogers, 53, from Romford, was found guilty of 14 counts including cruelty, rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.\nJason Adams, 43, from Norwich, was convicted of 13 similar counts.\nCarol Stadler, 60, from Atkinson Close, Bowthorpe, Norwich, was found guilty of assault causing actual bodily harm but cleared of nine other charges, including serious sexual assaults.\nThey are due to be sentenced on 28 September.\nSix other defendants, Anthony Stadler, 63, Nicola Collins, 36, Andrew Collins, 52, Judith Fuller, 32, Denise Barnes, 34, and Kathleen Adams, 84, all from Norwich, were cleared of all charges.\nBlack sobbed uncontrollably in the dock as the verdicts were delivered.\nOpening the trial, prosecutor Angela Rafferty QC said Black, previously known as Marie Adams, played an instrumental role in using the five children as \"sexual playthings\".\nThe abuse, which is said to have happened in and around Norwich and London, included forcing the children to have sex with one another.\nOn some occasions, the adults threw parties and played card games to decide who would abuse which child, Mrs Rafferty said.\nIn interviews the victims described how they were abused in front of one another and other adults.\nSome of the abuse involved children's toys, including Barbie dolls.\nAll of the defendants denied abusing the children, saying it simply did not happen.\nDuring the trial it emerged police had launched an investigation into the conduct of one agency social worker involved in the case.\nThe court heard that the trial had originally been due to start last year only to be delayed when prosecutors raised concerns over changes made by social workers to statements taken from the children.\nThis resulted in Norfolk Police launching an investigation into anomalies in documents. Prosecutors decided no action should be taken, Norfolk Police said after the trial.\nA police spokeswoman added: \"There was no wrongdoing found on the part of the council.\"\nSheila Lock, interim executive director of children's services at Norfolk County Council, said: \"The victims in this case have shown tremendous courage in speaking out.\n\"The needs of the children, who were central to the prosecution case, have always been at the fore of our minds and have been the main focus of all of the agencies involved.\n\"Our priority continues to be the children in this case who, despite the ordeal they have been through, are now doing well and are safe from harm.\"\nDeanna Neilson, head of safeguarding at Action for Children, said: \"This appalling case reveals the premeditated and organised approach some people take to abusing children.\n\"We cannot lose sight of the needs of the children who suffered at their hands, even though the abuse has stopped.\n\"Children must be supported, and in some cases receive therapy, to ensure they are armed with the confidence and knowledge they need to recover from this trauma.\"","summary":"A woman said to be at the centre of an abuse ring has been found guilty of child sex offences.","id":33674221}
