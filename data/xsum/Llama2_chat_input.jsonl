But there's a legacy of red tape on the railways, and it won't be cheap to sort out.\nRichard Price at the ORR says: \"Without up-to-date knowledge, Network Rail will not have sufficient understanding of how and why its assets fail and its maintenance approach will remain reactive - leading to inefficiencies and hindering its efforts to improve punctuality.\nHe adds: \"The new management at the company has made it clear that it shares our concerns and has committed to address these issues.\"\nThe current overspend is a worry too.

There have also been peaceful protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a police officer has been charged with manslaughter.\nThis is a recurring cycle of violence in the US. According to one research group, over 100 unarmed black people were killed by the police in 2015 and a string riots have occurred following similar shootings in 2016.\nBut what can be done to resolve this?\nFive US experts share their thoughts on rebuilding trust between black American communities and the police.\nLike any social problem, the first step is to simply acknowledge that a policing problem exists. I think one of the difficulties Americans are facing right now is that there is some disagreement as to whether there is a problem at all.\nOne practical thing that needs to be done immediately is to push towards more community policing. It really changes the dynamic, the cultural dynamic, because officers are members of the communities they operate in.\nIf a citizen shops at the same grocery store as his local police officer, they will recognise each other as human.\nI think a lot of the problems we see have to do with geography. You have to put people in the same geographical spaces, to occupy the same spaces.\nWhen you do, people see each other and interact with each other, not necessarily in the structured work environment, but in the unstructured social environment. That's why I think community policing works.\nChristopher Bracey is an expert on US race relations, individual rights and criminal procedure. He is professor of law at Georgetown University in Washington DC.\nThere's always a tendency to say let's train the police and they're not going to be prejudiced and the problem will go away. Well, no.\nThat's obviously important and needs to be done. But clearly, as we've seen in some of the shootings, even the officers have been black.\nI think the patterns of tension we are seeing now are rooted in long-term inequality and disadvantage.\nViolence has, for a long time, been concentrated in poor communities, especially segregated communities and minority communities that have been subject to disinvestment on the part of the state.\nSo in some sense, when you look at it scientifically, it's not really a surprise when you see occurrences of conflict between these people and the police.\nCriminal justice, housing and education reform really need to be coupled to address this issue.

His music includes a mix of music from classical to hard rock and Abba.\nThe Soma of Essex has been designed to be self-righting in the event of a capsize.\n\"It's designed to come up very quickly if it turns turtle,\" he said, \"and as long as I hold on tight I will be alright - even if I'm like\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n [\/INST]"}

A magnificent morning ascent for the youngest of the Nasa spaceplanes as it began its final mission - the delivery of the $2bn Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) instrument to the International Space Station.\nThere will, however, be a group of British engineers for whom Monday's lift-off was a bitter-sweet moment. These are the people whose technology got dropped from AMS in the year before launch.\nFor those not familiar with this story, let me back up and reprise events. They have some potentially fascinating implications for deep space travel.\nAMS is one of the most expensive science experiments ever put in space - probably the most expensive.\nIt has taken a group of 600 or so researchers from 16 nations a total of 17 years to prepare it for flight. It promises some dramatic new insights into the origin and make-up of the cosmos.\nAMS will do this by studying the storm of high-energy particles (cosmic rays) that are hurled at Earth from the deepest reaches of the Universe.\nCritical to its operation is a very strong magnet. As the particles enter AMS, they will bend through this magnet. How they bend reveals their charge, a fundamental property that says a great deal about the nature of those particles and where they came from.\nThe UK at a programmatic level never got involved in AMS, presumably because it was a space station project (and the UK doesn't engage with human spaceflight), but one British company was contracted to build the all-important magnet.\nScientific Magnetics (formerly Space Cryomagnetics) of Culham, in Oxfordshire, spent 12 years developing this super-cooled beast, and it was - so the project leaders on AMS told me - a marvel.\nIt was incredibly powerful and directed its entire field inwards, like an enclosed bubble. From the outside, the magnet appeared as an inert beer can.\nThis was really important because if you put such a device on a shuttle or a space station and it hasn't been carefully designed, it will start to interact with its surrounding - even try to orientate itself with the Earth's magnetic field. Not what you want on a space vehicle.\nBut to cut a long story short, the British magnet's super-fluid-helium cooling mechanism meant that it was only ever going to be a short-lived device.

The criteria include a high number of patients per GP and an \"inadequate\" or \"requires improvement\" rating by the regulator, the CQC.\nNHS chiefs said the aim was to provide support for practices under pressure and to ensure patients had continued access to high quality care.\nIn April 2016, NHS England announced an extra \u00a316m for this year for a so-called \"practice resilience programme\", with another \u00a324m in subsequent years.\nThis pool of money was also aimed at shoring up struggling practices and was part of the GP Practice Forward View unveiled by the head of NHS England Simon Stevens.\nBut a letter sent by Paul Twomey, medical director of the NHS England North Yorkshire and Humber area team, to local GPs and health officials in August suggests a harder line stance.\nIn it he says: \"The message we need to communicate to general practice is the GP Practice Forward View must be about transformation and in that\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n [\/INST]"}

Marine Le Pen appeared unperturbed.\nShe repeated her support for Moscow's annexation of Crimea, and her opposition to the sanctions subsequently imposed by the EU. If elected to the Elysee Palace, she pledged: \"I would envisage lifting the sanctions quite quickly.\"\nSo the meeting was a win for both. Madame Le Pen looked like a world-leader-in-waiting; Mr Putin received assurances from a woman who might become president of France, and who, like him, opposes the EU and Nato.\nBut there is more to the relationship between Mr Putin and Ms Le Pen than ideological convergence. Because of the National Front's racist and anti-Semitic past, French banks have declined to lend the party money.\nSo Marine Le Pen has been forced to look elsewhere for financing.\nIn 2014, the National Front took Russian loans worth \u20ac11m (\u00a39.4m). One of the loans, for \u20ac9m, came from a small bank, First Czech Russian Bank, with links to the Kremlin.\nThe loan was brokered by Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, an energy consultant turned MEP, who has called himself \"Mr Mission Impossible\".\nWhen I met him in Strasbourg, he told me he initially secured an agreement with a financial institution in Abu Dhabi, but the deal fell through. He even approached a potential lender in Iran, but Marine Le Pen vetoed the idea, he said. Eventually, he went to Russia.\nThe negotiations over the loan coincided with Russia's annexation of Crimea. EU governments condemned the annexation. Marine Le Pen publicly took the opposite view, leading some to question whether the loans were a quid-pro-quo.\nMr Schaffhauser denied he and Ms Le Pen ever discussed the issue of Crimea in relation to the loan.\n\"Always Marine Le Pen, and Jean-Marie before, was for co-operation with Russia,\" he said. \"It was not a political loan.  It was a commercial loan.\"\nBut Russia did want to use Ms Le Pen to legitimise its actions in Crimea.

Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged.\nAbout 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants.\nGovernment forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts.\nThe damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles.\nHowever, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says.\nIS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July.\nBy comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair.\nMirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport.\nStratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport.\nAlong with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base.\nIn contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS.\nAfter the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them.\nHowever, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n [\/INST]"}
