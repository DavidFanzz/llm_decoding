The miracle joins in the Atonement by placing the mind in the service of the Holy Spirit. This establishes the proper function of the mind and corrects its errors, which are merely lacks of love. Your mind can be possessed by illusions, but spirit is eternally free. If a mind perceives without love, it perceives an empty shell and is unaware of the spirit within.

One powerful group or faction of people getting too powerful and striking down the next strongest rival setting an example for others means we can fall into a reign of darkness through dictatorship. People in the world have grown to see the United States as a form of evil because of how we have used the medium of our money in the past to get things to done. We have done some mean things to many types of people in our long history but that does not mean we cannot learn from our mistakes and change our ways. Money at this moment is our dictator and is a literal measurement of freedom while it continues to maintain leverage over human need or act as a \"legal\" form of free speech. This fact is what supports what certain people think in terms of us being led down the path we are walking intentionally, given that they do not find it likely that our people are becoming weaker by accident. Our Founding Fathers would be disappointed that in other places in the world, we are working people at unfair wages on plantations among factories and running their dreams of freedom and prosperity into the ground while waving our star spangled banner on the flag poles. We would not sit on our hands if such folly was being done to us and for someone to think that anyone else would allow that is simply foolish. That is not the United States we were meant to become.

Once the two Daemons were vaguely conscious, they tried desperately to get free of the handcuffs and leave as soon as possible. Shadow Men weren't particularly tough. They're assassins. They went in, did the job, usually with pretty nasty results to send a message, and then left again. Now, I had the two of them locked down and was at the obvious advantage, meaning that they were in uncharted territory.

Tense with anticipation he picked up one of the books and reverently began leafing through the pages. There were hundreds of them, all of the finest pure white paper, neatly trimmed at the edge - and all completely blank. He examined a second, then a third. They were identical. Identical except... He examined several others, more carefully this time. The patterns on the covers were different, very similar but slightly different. Intrigued he looked at the knife and the tinder box. How had he not seen that before? He had noticed it, surely, but its significance had passed by his attention. The abstract patterns that adorned these gifts were different, but not randomly different. They had meaning, perhaps even part of a language he did not recognise or understand.\n"}

He was to immerse himself totally in a fluid, inside a sphere of dimensions just sufficient to contain him in the foetal position. The oxygen saturated fluid would replace the air in every otherwise air filled cavity of his body, including his lungs. Though he would not die, his evolutionary history as an air breathing mammal would force him to endure all the horror and panic associated with drowning. The sphere would then be sealed shut with him inside and fired - under an acceleration which would, but for the support of the fluid surrounding him, be instantly fatal - into the vacuum of space. Oddly enough, this first part of the process was not his biggest concern. He had already reacquainted his body and mind with the processes and physiology of liquid breathing over the past weeks by sitting submerged in the tank for longer and longer periods - up to several hours a few days prior. In any case he had done it all before - many times. Cannonballing was a popular sport back in the day, and occasionally even a practical means of getting around. That was long ago, but it was one of those things which, once tried, was not easily forgotten.\n"}

Certainly they would have been provided with the information needed to pinpoint humanity's home star, albeit in a gesture of little other than historic significance. And no doubt they would, somewhere, possess far more powerful instruments - powerful enough to resolve that star and the planets surrounding it, and match it up with whatever introductory information they had been sent. Of course any information that had been received was, as a matter of physical necessity, already thirteen million years out of date. The image he was observing at that moment was part of what he had carried here with him, like his own memories of the past. It was nothing more than an afterglow, an archival record showing the historic backdrop of whatever reality now existed. Somewhere in that image, though at a level of detail inaccessible to this or any other conceivable telescope, were the faces of people he had known - or maybe their grandchildren or great-great-grandchildren depending on factors of his own story still unknown - playing through like an old home movie. Those people would have been long gone in reality, passed into history, and then into prehistory, and then even from that - all but forgotten to everyone except him, just as he was probably now forgotten.

It shredded with only moderate force and he was able to pull large chunks out of the ground. It was the same as far down as he managed to dig. He stepped up to the surface of the dome and put his hands on it. It felt solid initially, but pushing harder produced enough movement to suggest it was flexible, bowed under the pressure within.\n"}

This meant that there was no discernible tilt between the plane of rotation and the plane of orbit.

Their experience also told them that the best way to gain concessions from Britain was through a step by step series of diplomatic advances. Analyzing the international balance of forces and London's need for their cooperation, they concluded that the same techniques might work in Palestine. Strikes, violence, and guerrilla activities would provide valuable added pressure but could not substitute for state-to-state dealings.

But with so many other questions to answer, and so much other work to do, he had deliberately avoided spending too much time thinking about it. He knew only too well the folly of speculating in the absence of evidence, but he also found such speculation a welcome distraction during the long hours of westward trudge. A possibility he had been considering was that he had been intercepted before reaching his destination and currently inhabited an isolated stellar system within the vast gulf between the galaxies. Such systems were known to exist, ejected from the galaxy of their birth and fated to wander alone for eternity. Perhaps that had been considered a suitably neutral territory, a place of safety to mitigate some perceived risk his Hosts felt he might have posed. Or maybe it was only in such a place that a joint effort by those who had sent him and those expected to pick him up could proceed on equal footing, two mutually alien powers merged at the vanguard of their expansion across the cosmos.

Simply on the grounds of your own experience with its teaching, should not this alone disqualify it as your future teacher? Yet the ego has done more harm to your learning than this alone. Learning is joyful if it leads you along your natural path, and facilitates the development of what you have. When you are taught against your nature, however, you will lose by your learning because your learning will imprison you. Your will is in your nature, and therefore cannot go against it.\n"}

However, the miracle entails a sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception. This introduces an interval from which the giver and receiver both emerge farther along in time than they would otherwise have been. The miracle thus has the unique property of abolishing time to the extent that it renders the interval of time it spans unnecessary. There is no relationship between the time a miracle takes and the time it covers. The miracle substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years. It does so by the underlying recognition of perfect equality of giver and receiver on which the miracle rests. The miracle shortens time by collapsing it, thus eliminating certain intervals within it. It does this, however, within the larger temporal sequence.\n"}

In the open air again he could see that the four approaching mobiles were considerably closer and continuing to advance. He carefully tucked the package he was holding into an empty pouch on his tool belt normally used for collecting samples, thinking it might be prudent now to make a run for the airlock. But his mobile ally seemed to be engaged in a new activity and he found himself compelled to wait and see what it was. A number of wasps were gathering bits of dried vegetation into a growing heap on the spongy ground, while the rest of the swarm waved up and down in a particularly strong abstract pattern that it kept repeating over and over. Meanwhile Pocahontas had ceased almost all activity, the entire swarm collapsing against the core of its hive in a tight mottled mound. It appeared to have gone into a state more akin to coma than the sleep-like condition of even the darkest hours of night. Then several wasps left off tending the pile of detritus and started up in a behaviour that he found not only unprecedented but rather disturbing. They began diving towards the pile and colliding with each other in pairs with such force that each of the pair was left momentarily stunned on the ground. At each collision he heard a pronounced click that seemed inconsistent with their soft bodies, until he realised that each was carrying with it a pebble or a shard of stone. It was only when he saw a small shower of sparks result from one collision that it dawned on him, simultaneously with a markedly increased shock, what was going on.\n"}

Sidqi, a Kurd and a colonel in the Ottoman army during World War I, only joined Iraq's army in 1921. Sulayman, too, had limited Arab nationalist credentials. As a member of the Young Turks party, the Committee for Union and Progress, and as director of education in Baghdad for the Ottoman regime, he had fought against the Hashemite Arab revolt. A long visit to Turkey in 1935 led Sulayman to praise the Attaturk regime when Arab-Turkish relations were at a low point. Even the Ahali group had clashed with the Arab nationalists because of its domestic and leftist orientations.42\n"}

I remember once we were walking in the country, my husband completely silent as usual, when he suddenly raised his head to look at the amazing sky and he began to speak clearly and with precision for a few sentences about the cirrus clouds above us, their specific properties and their defining characteristics.

In his mind he was drawn back to times he had lived for decades in claustrophobic conditions, parts of which had been every bit as tight and confining as where he was now. Those memories were very old and he was sure that life and those times were the source of his persistent dislike of confinement, yet somehow he felt that trying to remember them, knowing that he had survived there for so long, would be a comfort and strength now.\n"}

Innocent civilian casualties took place and due to United Nations guidelines, the United States soldiers were forced to remain passive due to the rules of engagement. We literally watched our compassion get stripped away from us and used against us by enemy combatants. I would argue that the animosity generated over allowing such injustice, allowing the enemy to become the populations food source again and a combination of a drug given out to people by enemy leadership is what caused the events of the battle in Mogadishu where two black hawk helicopters were brought down. It would have seriously burdened our enemy morale and resources if our soldiers were allowed to protect the people and the goods we meant to provide for them.\n"}

Moreover, even after 1948 the traditional elites maintained their friendly ties with the West. The Palestine issue is not required to explain the hatred of England on the part of the Muslim Brotherhood or the Iraqi Istiqlalists. Nasser, on the other hand, seemed quite willing to explore a close relationship with the United States. The break between the new Arab regimes and the United States beginning in the late 1950s had more to do with the Aswan Dam and the Baghdad Pact than it did with American Palestine policy in 1948.\n"}

The dancers first formed a bow with their legs and then began to shake them as if rendered uncontrollable by Parkinson's disease. As the leg-shaking progressed they raised their shoulders rhythmically in an over-gestured shrug and stylishly dropped them with the palms almost landing at the centre of the lower abdomen, switching from the left arm to the right and back like a pendulum.

Therefore, they were wary given the unique needs of each person with dementia, of having specific rules and guidelines to follow in relation to which strategy to choose. Similar to the health professionals they felt that irrespective of the strategies used educating carers on their use should be a pre-requisite to implementation. Similarly to the informal\/unpaid carers people with dementia were less concerned with the name given to the different strategies as long as the strategies used were respectful, mindful of the person's dignity and autonomy and self-esteem. In this context, acceptable approaches included therapeutic lying as well as the use of distraction and avoiding the false statement or question asked. Participants were clear that the dignity of the person with dementia must never be undermined and highlighted the importance of trust in relationships and the importance of carers taking time to get to know and understand the person. Such encounters have the potential to promote dignity (Jacobson 2012). The environment where two people meet is also important. If the person with dementia does not feel safe and secure then the potential for violation of dignity is increased. Finally, the policy and social context, within which encounters take place, has a major influence on whether encounters will promote or violate dignity. It is imperative therefore that the context of care provision for people with dementia is unhurried, non-hierarchical and flexible, so that dignity can be promoted and nurtured (Jacobson 2012).\n"}

The blame was on environmental pollution. New laws to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were accepted. I must stress that I have nothing against such laws, they are necessary, but in relation to unusual weather conditions, I have my own theory. I know there have been unusual weather conditions since the Earth exists. In my opinion, the changes have always been due to the position of the planets and not to what we are doing on the Earth.

During a severe pandemic, public sector efforts to control the outbreak are likely to become overwhelmed. But industry assets, if swiftly and appropriately deployed, could help to save lives and reduce economic losses. For instance, companies with operations focused on logistics, social media, or distribution systems will be needed to enable governments' emergency response, risk communications, and medical countermeasure distribution efforts during a pandemic. This includes working together to ensure that strategic commodities are available and accessible for public health response. Contingency planning for a potential operational partnership between government and business will be complex, with many legal and organizational details to be addressed. Governments should work now to identify the most critical areas of need and reach out to industry players with the goal of finalizing agreements in advance of the next large pandemic. The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board would be well positioned to help monitor and contribute to the efforts that governments, international organizations and businesses should take for pandemic preparedness and response.\n"}

The ego teaches non-stop that we are always lacking something, needing something which really means we are vulnerable. And this of course means we need protection (another lack). The miracle shows us that we lack nothing and thereby need no protection. Protection of spirit is merely the invulnerability of spirit. We have already heard that a child of God cannot be hurt. That is one of the clearest understandings of the crucifixion. This is what Jesus taught us: despite what the world perceived, nothing was done to him. His body may have been attacked, but he could not have been attacked. He identified with the protection of spirit because he knew who he was, therefore it did not matter what was done to his body. That is the protection of sprit.\n"}

Even so he could feel the heat of the flame at the back of his neck as it threatened to outpace him. Only when he had reached the safety of what he assumed was flame resistant clay soil, and some way beyond even that, did he stop to survey the damage he had caused. The whole landscape where he had been standing only moments before was ablaze in a wall of flame and smoke he could not see beyond. What he could see horrified him. Pocahontas, the helplessly sessile kenthoni that had given him, an alien stranger, aid when he needed it, was now immersed in flame - and by his own hand no less. The bulk of the swarm still clung tight around the core mass - perhaps as a form of protection - scarcely moving, though bright airborn embers flying off he took to be individual wasps instinctively trying to escape the inferno. He wondered if it could feel pain as he understood the concept - and hoped against hope that it could not. The only consoling thought he had to absolve the guilt and remorse he felt at that moment was to recall that, even on Earth, there were many species of plant that utilised the natural occurrence of bushfire to close their life cycle.

Perhaps today, you can examine the feelings you are experiencing at different moments and see if they are ego based or Spirit centered. Remember sanity is of Spirit, and insanity is offered by ego. Look at the history of wars and see how ego's joined together for a short time to attack other ego's and then later separated back into themselves and attacked even those they had been in union just before. We have learned thus far that giving and receiving are but one and the same. Quite a different definition than the one we had been accustomed to before the Course. And so it is no real surprise that we are being reminded again that in order for us to have, we must give all of what we are to all that we look upon  we must give the Love we are to the Love we see  and as we give, we receive.\n"}

The explanation of last resort is that actions abroad seek to distract attention from problems at home. Obviously, multiparty democracies require the forming of coalitions, the winning of elections, the shaping of public opinion, and the response to mass media necessary to gain and remain in power. But \"domestic politics\" should not be viewed too narrowly. The term can also cover the competition between political factions, individual politicians, and underground oppositions. It might be necessary to respond to potential internal subversion or the discontent of military officers. Since Arab politics rested on a clear set of definitions over what was \"right\" and \"wrong,\" deviations from these norms could be expected to bring retribution. In other words, foreign policy could not be insulated in such societies to the extent that it was in nineteenth-century European polities or in contemporary communist totalitarian states.\n"}

I believe if people wanted to be a slob and a dead-beat to society that it is their right as a free individual to do so. I really do doubt that many people would once they get too comfortable and bored with the basics. As I went into some detail in chapter four about the shelter aspect of what the Expedition would do and not do, you can in some ways apply that to foods that are hard to come by. The Expedition would provide for needs, not wants. If you still want something you need to go out and serve a purpose to earn it. The Human Expedition is not a free ride for people contrary to what many people will try and label it. There are some types of resources that are limited and those resources do need to be cultivated and maintained with balance somehow. Cosmetic surgeries would be an expense people would pay for out of pocket. Since driving a car is a privilege and not a given right considering how limited fuel sources are seemingly becoming the expedition will not provide that either. The primary service the Expedition would provide our country is generation of surplus to negate all the debt that has haunted us for some time. Helping each other get what we need will help us all get the chance to earn what we want. We all need a fair opportunity in life and most of us in some way or another want to make a positive difference somehow. This is our chance.\n"}

It had certainly not been there the previous day when he was rummaging around for firewood. It could scarcely have been more obvious had it been illuminated by neon signs. With the exception of the incubation tower he'd emerged from, it was the only thing he had seen since arriving here that looked even remotely unnatural. He cautiously poked it a few times with a stick before daring to touch it with his hands and finally picking it up. It was light and felt flimsy in has hands - even as he turned it over to examine it the untextured faces and corners began to flake away and fall to the ground in a fine powder, as if it was made of nothing more than loosely packed chalk dust. As it crumbled under his touch he felt a jolt of recognition - he had seen this stuff before, or something very like it. On Aurigae, on Kruger long ago, even on Earth he had seen it. This was the sign of manufacturing being carried out at the smallest of physical scales.

The ego draws upon the one source that is totally inimical to its existence for its existence. Fearful of perceiving the power of this source, it is forced to depreciate it. This threatens its own existence, a state which it finds intolerable. Remaining logical but still insane, the ego resolves this completely insane dilemma in a completely insane way.

Jacobson's work is grounded in human rights and promotion of equality. Jacobson argues that every human interaction has the potential to be a 'dignity encounter'. These encounters she argues can result in one of two outcomes: the promotion of dignity or the violation of dignity. Dignity violation is more likely to result from an encounter in which there is a power imbalance with one person placed in a position of vulnerability due for example to cognitive impairment as in the case of the person with dementia. The impact is further exacerbated when the other actor is not sympathetic due to prejudice, personality or ignorance. The setting in which encounters take place can also exacerbate the situation. So-called harsh environments that fail to take account of the diversity of users, serve to reinforce distance and power imbalances. Jacobson (2009) characterises these settings as hierarchal and inflexible characterised by stress and a sense of urgency but deficient in resources. The people working in such environments are less likely to be empathetic to others and are also more likely to perceive questioning or non-cooperation as an 'attack on their dignity'. Being in a 'position' of vulnerability is at the core of dignity violation. This vulnerability may stem from internal factors such as physical disability, and\/or cognitive impairment and external factors such as lack of knowledge or skills.\n"}

Significantly, the codes of conduct for key health professionals e.g. nursing, medicine occupational therapists and physiotherapists stress that each individual practitioner must tell the truth. In fact being untruthful is likely to put professional registration at risk.

Perhaps, he thought, in the absence of any other visible reference and in the restlessness of a disturbed slumber, he had simply become disoriented, but his intuitive sense of direction was strongly suggesting that glow was in the west, not the east. As he stood watching it, trying to recalibrate his orientation, it slowly but perceptibly faded from view, leaving the night totally dark again.

Evolution is a process in which you seem to proceed from one degree to the next. You correct your previous missteps by stepping forward. This process is actually incomprehensible in temporal terms, because you return as you go forward. The Atonement is the device by which you can free yourself from the past as you go ahead. It undoes your past errors, thus making it unnecessary for you to keep retracing your steps without advancing to your return. In this sense the Atonement saves time, but like the miracle it serves, does not abolish it. As long as there is need for Atonement, there is need for time. But the Atonement as a completed plan has a unique relationship to time. Until the Atonement is complete, its various phases will proceed in time, but the whole Atonement stands at time's end. At that point the bridge of return has been built.\n"}

The only things representing a living form were those forms themselves - the plants that grew wild along the streets or in the parks, the birds that flew among the buildings and nested on the high ledges, the spiders whose webs he sometimes had to brush from the doorway of a new building before he entered. Any resemblances that did exist were purely incidental and were more a function of his own imagination than any likely intention of the creators. In fact there was very little that represented any objective reality - no maps or models or photographs or paintings depicting a still life or a landscape. It was not as if the Hosts were ignorant of the shape of terrestrial life. They had, after all, renovated a whole world and populated it from scratch with that very life. Anything that necessitated some nod to the form of the human body for practical or ergonomic reasons did so to the minimum degree. It was an omission which, once noticed, became glaring and obvious.\n"}

Otherwise they may unwittingly foster the belief that release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent. This misperception arises in turn from the belief that harm can be limited to the body. That is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself. None of these errors is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist. This recognition is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because it introduces correction at the level of the error. It is essential to remember that only the mind can create, and that correction belongs at the thought level. To amplify an earlier statement, spirit is already perfect and therefore does not require correction. The body does not exist except as a learning device for the mind. This learning device is not subject to errors of its own, because it cannot create. It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up its miscreations is the only application of creative ability that is truly meaningful.\n"}

When the State Department's Dean Rusk, suggested an international peace-keeping force to police the truce and trusteeship, the Arabs were not enthusiastic. Even his remarkable suggestion that Egypt, as a leading Arab League member and a relative moderate, might participate in this multinational unit did not change Cairo's mind.16\n"}

The juxtaposition of elements so obviously pointed to one particular conclusion that he barely hesitated in pushing the lever forward. As it happened his assumption proved entirely correct. A light shower of dust shook free from the rail overhead and fell around him, as though this was the first time the mechanism had operated in decades, but it nevertheless lurched instantly to life and the carriage down the track sped away at a considerable pace.

Demonstrations had been planned on the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration to protest British policy in Palestine. A broad range of organizations, student groups, and political parties endorsed the idea, but their preparations were inadequate. Rather than a peaceful march, the results were mob attacks and looting at Jewish stores and synagogues. Greek and Armenian establishments were also attacked. By 12:45 p.m. twenty thousand people proceeded to the palace, ransacking shops along the way as police watched. Muslim Brotherhood leader Hassan al-Banna finally managed to disperse the crowd, and the Wafd party dissociated itself from the violence. As long as the Jews did not support Zionism, Nahhas told community leaders, they would be safe. Still, even though only 109 of the 500 shops pillaged were owned by Jews, their sense of security was shattered.28\n"}

He called it the Small Brown Spot, an accurate reflection of both its size and colour in comparison to the surrounding region. It had a number of features that had drawn it to his attention over a period of several days' observation. Firstly it was cleanly circular in shape. Of course that was difficult to know for sure given its small size, but it seemed to lack the irregular border of other surface features giving it an unnatural appearance. Secondly, it sat very neatly on the divide between two of the major masses of near black - the dark green of Grand Australis on the left, and the even larger mass of dark red to the right, which was north. Whatever those colour variations might signify, that placement seemed to be purposeful. Like the Mid Range mountains far off to the south-west, it appeared to have an effect on the patterns of cloud and weather around it, and looked to be casting a particularly long shadow at the appropriate times of day when conditions were clear enough to see it. Moreover when the clouds in its vicinity were calm it often even appeared above them, a clear brown dot on a field of white. All of this suggested its true size was very large for such an isolated thing. And when the surrounding surface was darkened by shadow or night, it was that spot which most often marked concentrations of faint points of light nearby. Finally there were recent measurements which placed it almost, but not quite, at the very centre of the disk from his point of view, and subsequent very rough calculations suggesting the deviation was more due to his own position than its. If those estimates were correct, he surmised, by the time he reached his destination at Ninety Long that spot would be at the exact point on the surface of Lune closest to him.\n"}

The kenthoni wasps had meant business, slicing through his clothes and into the flesh of his back and legs as well as the exposed areas of his face and hands, and stabbing him with needles of sharpened stone, many of which he had found still embedded in his scalp and shoulders. Fortunately, though extensive, those wounds were mainly superficial, most only drawing a trickle of blood and all missing major arteries. He could not yet bring himself to conclude that this happy fact was the result of good intention rather than simple good luck. The truth was that, for whatever reason, some part of the intelligent population of that planet had regarded him as their enemy and had wanted to cause him serious harm. At the very least they had wanted to drive him from their world, at which task they had succeeded. It didn't matter that he had also found allies among them. It didn't matter that he had learnt a great deal during the time on Lune. His mood for much of the time during those first days following his return were mired in a haze of self doubt and reproach that on occasions came dangerously close to loathing. He had been entrusted with a single great purpose - sent across the gulf that separates not just worlds but whole galaxies as the representative of humanity to a new race of beings. But that task had ended in failure - despised by the very beings he had been sent to connect with, and abandoned by the ones who had sent him. In the better moments he wondered if, maybe, at some time in the future, he might be able to return and make reparation for the damage he had done, but mostly that seemed like a forlorn hope. He was alone again with no idea what the next phase of his life would be, or even if there was one.\n"}

He had explored along the coast over a span of tens of kilometres, from the west where the path was blocked by a field of bare jagged rocks, to the east where he was stopped by an unfordable river delta - taking in bluffs and inlets, pebbly beaches and shorelands covered by the ever present sponge lawn.

Minimising truth-related distress or agitation was the main reasons for lying. Carer participants expressed concern however, that lying could increase the person with dementia's confusion or negatively impact on their relationship with the person. Several alternative strategies to managing the person's anxiety, stress or agitation were identified. These ranged from: telling the truth, moving on the conversation, reframing the situation, distraction and \"going with\" the person. Carer participants did however confront or correct the person if they believed it was in their best interests. \"Empathetic deception\" captures their approach to \"lying\" or telling the truth: it was done in the person's best interest, in context of knowing what matters to the person and in a way that maintained the person's dignity. The person's capacity (loosely aligned to stage of dementia) was also considered and reflected in using different types of strategies e.g. it was more likely that carers would tell the truth in earlier stages and lie by omission or avoidance in the later stages. At the heart of carers' actions was the intention to benefit the person. They viewed an individualised approach, tailored to the person's needs and life history as critical, they questioned the benefit of hard and fast rules on \"what to do\" therefore. In context of the actions that formal carers should take, carers saw that therapeutic lying was appropriate when it benefited and respected the person's dignity. They viewed themselves as the representatives of the person with dementia's personhood in the later stages because they knew them, knew their life history and knew what mattered to them. Consequently they considered they had a role to play in preserving the person. They advised that in formal care settings a care plan should be agreed that reflected this knowledge.\n"}

Functions are part of being since they arise from it, but the relationship is not reciprocal. The whole does define the part, but the part does not define the whole. Yet to know in part is to know entirely because of the fundamental difference between knowledge and perception. In perception the whole is built up of parts that can separate and reassemble in different constellations. But knowledge never changes, so its constellation is permanent.

Strategies include both the person with dementia and their carer retreating together into the past, and in doing so, experiencing the lived and more vivid experiences of the person with dementia. Feil (1993) contends that living in the past is not as demanding of the person with dementia as it concentrates on their preserved abilities, i.e., their ability to recall past memories. In contrast to living in an unfamiliar present, retreating to a familiar past is far more pleasing and less stressful for the person with dementia (Douglas et al. 2004). According to Kitwood (1997), validation therapy is recognised as offering a good level of empathy with the intention of understanding a person's entire frame of reference. However, researchers argue that, like many psychosocial interventions advocated for use in dementia care, validation therapy does not have a definitive theoretical underpinning and the evidence to support its use stems largely from observational studies. These studies report that, validation therapy promotes better communication and interaction between the carer and person with dementia; it has a positive effect on behavioural symptoms and enhances the quality of life of both carer and person with dementia (Bleathman & Morton, 1988; Babins, 1998). However, converse to findings arising from qualitative studies, evidence from the most recent Cochrane systematic review (Neal & Wright, 2003), evaluating the effectiveness of validation therapy for people with dementia concludes that there is inadequate evidence to support the use of validation therapy for people with dementia. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review but because of the diversity in duration of treatment, lack of comparability between control groups and outcome measurements, pooled analysis was not feasible. The review authors concluded that, as yet, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of validation therapy for people with dementia.\n"}

The surface he was lying on was hard and slippery, the liquid pooling across it - not water, but more like thick mucous - slimy and just lukewarm enough in enough places to feel disgustingly organic. With no friction to push against every attempt at movement left him flaying helplessly on one spot. More than that, he was being held loosely by protrusions from his abdomen and the back of his neck that tightened on some distant anchor if he managed to twist too far. He grabbed at the one in his belly, digging fingernails into its fleshy surface to gain purchase against the slime and tried to pull it out away from him. There was pain, but not so much as to overcome the feeling that this was a foreign thing that had to be removed. As it came free he realised what this was - it was his placenta, his own afterbirth that had been feeding him nourishment for however long he had been there. And the one in his neck, which he attended to next, had been doing the same thing with information - his memories, his skills, his personality - pumping his very soul into a new brain.

The children of humankind had been mindful of this even as they spread themselves across space. They were mindful, too, of the importance of carrying their most sacred principles with them wherever they went and had devised subtle and clever schemes to ensure that it was ever the case. But within those schemes they had placed, very deliberately, a single loophole. It was an exception forced by a deep conflict between two of their own most elemental moral rules: never to interfere and always to tell the truth. So it was accepted that should humanity, in the course of its study of the universe, ever encounter a mind similar to itself - in broad terms, intellectually, technologically and morally - then contact would be allowed that went both ways.\n"}

Qualitative description aims to describe participants' perceptions, responses and concerns and to comprehensively summarise these (Sandelowski 2000). A qualitative descriptive approach is appropriate when seeking to understand complex 'phenomena' (as is the case in this study) and the use of this approach provides a description of and facilitates understanding of persons' with dementia and informal\/unpaid carer's experiences and perceptions. The strength of qualitative descriptive designs in comparison to other qualitative approaches is that it \"obtains straight and largely unadorned (i.e. minimally theorized) answers to questions of relevance to practitioners and policy makers\" (Sandelowski 2000 p.337). Using this approach enabled the collection of detailed feedback from persons with dementia and informal\/unpaid carers on their experiences. Qualitative descriptive design uses an \"eclectic but reasonable and well-considered combination\" of sampling, data collection and data analysis techniques (Sandelowski 2000). In this study focus group interviewing was used to collect data from participants.\n"}

He remembered there was a single hook left along with the hammer on his tool belt, and he was now grateful he'd not had the presence of mind to release it a moment earlier when it was dragging him under. With some effort he managed to pound the hook into the bark far enough under the surface to provide a rest for one foot, smashing several barkfish in the process and spilling their insides into the muck around him, before inadvertently letting the hammer slip from his fingers and into the dark depths. Even with that support he tried and failed several times to reach the rope, every attempt bringing him closer to the exhaustion and muscle fatigue he knew was to be avoided if he was to keep any gains he made.

In one direction the river meandered its way from left to right, cutting a swathe through coarse grained sand. The opposite bank of the river opened out into an expanse of grass and scrubby bushes, and beyond that in the distance he could make out clumps of trees, maybe the beginnings of a forest. In the other direction was nothing but gently rolling dunes of sand for as far as he could see, punctuated here and there by dead trees bleached white from wind and weather. Standing prominently by itself in the middle distance was the black mushroom shaped tower from which he had emerged the previous day.

A robust international stockpile could therefore help to ensure that low and middle resource settings receive needed supplies regardless of whether they produce such supplies domestically. Countries with national supplies or domestic manufacturing capabilities should commit to donating some supply\/product to this virtual stockpile. Countries should support this effort through the provision of additional funding.\n"}

The main ethical principles affected are","gold_ref":"There are many ethical concerns associated with the practice of therapeutic lying which make it very challenging (Culley et al. 2013). The main ethical principles affected are autonomy, beneficence and non-maleficence. Autonomy centres on the person's right to self-determination and the carer's role in promoting independence for the purpose of realising self-determination (Barber & Lyness, 2001). Beneficence is about making decisions that are in the best interest of the person with dementia and non-maleficence is about minimising harm to the person with dementia (Barber & Lyness, 2001). Therapeutic lying can threaten a person's autonomy when it is used to deny the voice of the person with dementia in their care whilst only achieving short term goals such as reducing agitation (Brannelly and Whitewood (2014). However, therapeutic lying may be considered acceptable when non-maleficence and compassion are its motives (Sperber 2014; Stubbs, 2013; Tuckett, 2012). It is also important to consider the impact of therapeutic lying on the carer. Trust is a moral principle of care, and lying compromises the trusting relationship between the person with dementia and their carer (Feil & Altman, 2004; Schermer, 2007; Barnes & Brannelly, 2008). This behaviour\/action may therefore have a negative impact on the carer who may feel uncomfortable with the deception and the associated impact on their integrity (Schermer, 2007). The literature also highlights that the stage of dementia is an important consideration when deciding to use therapeutic lying. Taylor (2007), writing from the perspective of the person with dementia, asserts that lying is not acceptable to people in the early stages of dementia as it heightens that disconnect that they experience from reality. However as dementia progresses and capacity diminishes, the less possible it becomes for the person with dementia to entertain beliefs, either false or true. Schermer (2007) purports that lying to someone requires a capacity to hold beliefs about what is true and what is not, thus making it conceptually impossible to lie to someone in an advanced state of dementia. If a person is not aware of being 'lied' to due to memory loss, the 'deception' may be viewed as less threatening and potentially beneficial (Kartalova-O'Doherty et al. 2014). Lying with an intention to cause harm is never acceptable.\n"}

That life ended, as did most human lives at the time, in a way that he had not planned and would not have chosen even if he could. What he had chosen was the most audacious gamble - to remove death's ultimate sting, its finality, by having his body preserved with nothing more than the hope, unproven and extremely remote, that a preserved body would be all that was needed to reconstruct the soul. That gamble, in the end, had paid up. His second life was in some ways more relaxed, though in other ways fuller and more complete. He'd travelled widely and experienced more of what the Earth had to offer. He'd seen the places that had once been pristine wilderness, had succumbed to occupation by human civilisation and then returned to wilderness once more as populations retreated. It was one of those places, specifically the coastal hinterland of Eastern Africa, around Tanzania or Mozambique, that was being called to mind here as he made his way through the grasslands. A long forgotten safari in a distant place now reproduced, from what he could recall, with great fidelity.\n"}

For the incumbent regime, the results might be fatal.

Wisely, Iraq and other hawkish regimes concentrated their persuasive powers on King Farouk instead of his prime minister.

When a city found out Alexander and his army was on its' way, local people assisted in his efforts and celebrated his arrival because he did more than bring armed soldiers and endless violence to those who rivaled his campaign. Alexander brought prosperity and everyone in that time frame knew that when Alexander came it meant that they had full stomachs, a place to sleep and a new found purpose in life that did not previously exist. This very same variable is also why Alexander did not very often ever need to back track and could keep moving forward. He empowered the populations of cities he previously invaded to protect this new found glory in his absence even after replenishing the ranks of the fallen among those who marched in his campaign. Alexander the Great has already proven the strategy behind the U.S.H.E will work and effectively. Never since Alexander, has Earth seen a military achievement that came close to what he had accomplished even though he was limited by his time frame.\n"}

President Obama faced a Congress that may still repeal the bill due to it being unconstitutional to obligate anyone to any type of service. Before anyone tries to say I am going to create a system of free loaders, I will state that I am calling for the utilization of resources that are costing tax dollars and still yet remain to be processed. The United States Government as taught in colleges and even some high schools across the country, are paying many land owners subsidies to not grow crops or raise livestock on their fields and these lands lay dormant. All that money is spent in the name of controlling our economy which in reality, our government has very little or no control over anyway. Tragically, part of the reason we are in this mess is because we already have too many people getting paid to do nothing. Ironically enough, it is those people who usually harass others about not doing enough to progress the workload of our country and vote to try and deny benefits to those who are legitimately injured working dangerous or difficult jobs. It would be far more effective to get a little bit out of everyone over driving those who are working into early graves. With the private distribution of wealth manipulating housing, food, career opportunity and medical costs it is no wonder not everyone is having their needs met. The U.S Human Expedition would use volunteers out in the fields we have paid an overabundance to do nothing with to feed the hungry and show the world that our strength is supported by compassion. I cannot stress enough that our government should not be passing this opportunity onto religious organizations. The Expedition would offer dorms or apartments to get people off the streets and allow those who have been struggling against poverty to stabilize themselves and stand on their own feet once more or even for the first time. With the U.S. Human Expedition in place and in co-operation with President Obama's health care plan, insurance underwriters will not have the chance to deny someone life over frivolous paperwork errors and those with pre-existing conditions will not face a lapse in care. During the transition, the U.S. Human Expedition will have experts assigned to cases where legitimate claims are denied in the name of money. At one point the military may be in control of medical care so the private distribution of wealth cannot over capitalize on an individual's right to live at the choke point of medical needs and force the inability to fulfill the unrealistic demands of such monetary costs. In many situations, spouses have spent themselves into homelessness trying to save their dying life partner. There is a stigma and misconception that people who end up homeless did something to deserve to be there. While that may be true in some cases, there are several circumstances that can cause it to happen to almost anyone. I have even heard some call it \"natural selection\".\n"}

Olivia was expecting either a kid or a deranged hermit, so she was startled to see a young woman, maybe 20, with long tangled brown hairthe bottom half bleached blonde. She wore a faded blue sweatshirt and cutoffs. Her pretty face was streaked with dirt and tears, and she sneered at Olivia who regarded her silently, then realized she was the girl who had been hanging out at the campground all summer. A tweaker. Olivia had wanted to call the state cops on her long ago, first when the girl gave her stringy boyfriend a blow job right in the middle of the meadow, and then a month later after a camper caught her ripping off his ice-chest. But Duane always cut the poor guttersnipe a break because she was the daughter of one of his high school buddies. Her name was Lacey something.\n"}

If you were to leave at this point, then I know that I would eventually come to find you. I struggle now in those short hours that I cannot see your face.

The first few days would be in familiar country - he even had planned to collect some final supplies of fruit and water at a known spring along the way. But the knowledge that he was leaving behind what he had built with seven years of hard lonely toil, what, in spite of the challenges, he had come to consider home, at least indefinitely and possibly forever, did pull at his emotions in many directions. Of course there was always the chance it would fail completely and he would be back within a month, but he had made a deliberate choice not to think in those terms. There was a brief moment in which the magnitude of this undertaking felt overwhelming, almost enough to make him rethink it. He was putting faith on nothing more than the slimmest of chances that the point on the surface of this world closest to its moon was different from any other point. As a speculation it was an interesting one to be sure, but the reality meant a journey, he had estimated, of ten thousand kilometres to find out. Ten thousand kilometres until what was now a partial disk peeking up from behind distant hills was full and clear and directly overhead. And that assumed his calculation of the size of this planet was accurate. With luck it would prove to be an overestimate, but it was just as likely that he would need to go significantly further. The undertaking was almost certain to be arduous, and was very likely not possible at all. There was every chance that some natural barrier - an unscalable mountain range, or an uncrossable river, or an ocean - would prevent him reaching the destination. Ten thousand kilometres, he repeated to himself. Ten thousand kilometres of unknown terrain, of unforeseen obstacles and challenges and dangers - and discoveries.\n"}
