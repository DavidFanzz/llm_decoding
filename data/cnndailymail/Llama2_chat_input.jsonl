{"instructions":"[INST] Article: The federal agent who helped bring down Lance Armstrong has been appointed as the UFC's new Vice President of Athlete Health and Performance. Jeff Novitzky, who was also involved in the investigations into Barry Bonds, Marion Jones and Justin Gatlin, will spearhead the development of the UFC's new drug testing programme. The organisation announced earlier this year that they will implement a new year-round, out-of-competition testing protocol following a string of high-profile failed tests by Anderson Silva, Nick Diaz and Hector Lombard. Jeff Novitsky will join the UFC as the sport bids to clean up its act after high-profile failed drugs tests. Anderson 'The Spider' Silva (right) tested positive for drostanolone metabolites and androstane. Barry Bonds holds the MLB record for home runs but his achievements are tainted by allegations of PED use. 'There is no bigger advocate of clean professional sports than Jeff Novitzky,' UFC Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Lawrence Epstein said. 'When we announced our commitment for an enhanced drug testing program in February, we wanted to ensure that the best people would be helping move this program forward and Jeff will lead the UFC in developing the most comprehensive anti-doping policy in professional sports.' Novitzky added: 'I am thrilled to be joining a world-class organization like UFC, that is committed to taking the necessary steps to ensure all of its athletes are competing in a clean sport. 'I am confident that UFC will be able to create a new gold standard testing program and implement it so a sustainable and level playing field is provided for all athletes.'\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

At the peak of her career as an England netball player who won bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, she earned just \u00a3742 a month. But there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality. She is Phil Neville's twin and I ask her which of them, back on January 21, 1977, emerged first. 'I don't think there was ever any way Philip was coming out before me,' she says in a broad Bury accent enriched by an endearing burst of laughter. Tracey Neville, pictured at Hotel Football in Manchester, is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville. Neville gives a team talk to her Manchester Thunder players during a match with Surrey Storm last year. England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville poses with his sister Tracey and her friends. It might explain why it is Tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first, taking England's netball team to this summer's World Cup in Australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting. Gary has spent the past three years as assistant to England manager Roy Hodgson. Tracey was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in August. Winning it will be no easy task, even if England are ranked third in the world. They failed to win a medal in last year's Commonwealth Games and poor results in a recent Test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38-year-old Neville, who has performed impressively as the boss at Manchester Thunder. How England perform will impact on funding with up to \u00a34million at stake. The pressure is on. She revived an ageing Thunder team with an injection of youth and has secured two Superleague titles in three years. They are top of the league and later this month will contest their Superleague semi-final at the Manchester Arena, with some suggesting there are echoes of a certain local football team. Like Gary and Phil, she was first capped for her country at 19, eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire \u2014 and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers'.

Wawrinka is the defending champion in Monte Carlo and seldom has a title been relinquished so easily. The Swiss No 2 played like he was in a hurry - and not in a good way. Rushing between points, Wawrinka won the first of the match and then made four unforced errors in a row to surrender his serve. Grigor Dimitrov powers a forehand from the back court in his comfortable win over Stan Wawrinka. Wawrinka, the Monte Carlo Masters defending champion, appeared out of sorts in the 6-1 6-2 defeat. The world No 9 looked listless and disinterested, rolling in 95mph first serves and ballooning groundstrokes long. He did not appear to be injured but something was very clearly wrong; four winners and 41 unforced errors cannot be put down merely to a bad day at the office. Wawrinka's coach Magnus Norman is not in Monte Carlo this week and, watching at home, he may have been glad of the opportunity to turn off the television. Dimitrov moves through to the quarter-finals where the Bulgarian will meet Frenchman Gael Monfils. Wawrinka wasn't at his finest as he failed to get on the board in the match until the fifth game. In the second, Wawrinka played a little better - he could scarcely have played worse - but still gave Dimitrov a generous helping of mistakes. The world No 11 broke early and Wawrinka served to stay in the match at 5-2 down. Four tame unforced errors later and Dimitrov was through to the last eight. The crowd on court central would have expected a thrilling encounter between two of the most expressive players on tour. Instead, they were treated to an abject and mystifying performance from Wawrinka. The 30-year-old finally got on the board in the fifth game of the match, although this was down more to errors from Dimitrov - who wasn't even playing especially well himself - than any improvement from the Swiss. But the Bulgarian broke for a third time and closed out the first set 6-1. Dimitrov and a disappointed Wawrinka shake hands at the end of the quickfire encounter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

The 283 per cent rise, which comes after it emerged City were increasing the cost of some season tickets for able-bodied fans from \u00a3870 to \u00a31,700, has been strongly criticised by some of those affected. They claim the Premier League champions are trying to force migration to other parts of the Etihad Stadium as part of a wide-ranging re-seating plan following a 6,000-seat extension which will see capacity rise to around 55,000. Manchester City have been accused of trying to relocate disabled fans by hiking up season ticket prices. The disabled bays subject to the huge increase are in the same section of the stadium as the season tickets that have risen from \u00a3870 to \u00a31,700 - the prime pitchside second tier. City say that area has been transformed into a premium location, and that ticket holders will receive a programme, parking and access to executive bars - an offering they did not have this season. They add that they do not wish to discriminate and have to ensure they give the same offering to all supporters. But some of the disabled fans say the improved offering is useless to them and point out that they are in wheelchairs, and so will not have the benefit of an upgraded padded seat. The reigning Premier League champions celebrate victory over West Ham in their last game. Mark Barber is the secretary of the Manchester City Disabled Supporters Association who released a statement saying they were disgusted with club. He said: 'It affects users in the Colin Bell and East Stands. They pay \u00a3345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost \u00a3975.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: They were the biggest of the Ice Age giants, roaming the frozen plains of the Northern Hemisphere. But it seems the final days of the woolly mammoth were a sad struggle for survival. Genetic analysis of two woolly mammoth remains show that their population became so small that they had become chronically inbred. Scroll down for video. The last of the woolly mammoths (shown in the reconstruction above) were isolated on an Arctic island for around 5,000 years, forcing them to inbreed as their population dwindled until disappering 4,500 years ago. Researchers have concluded that the creatures clung on in just a tiny pocket of the Arctic, on an island that appears to have become cut off from the mainland. The study has also raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cloning techniques with modern elephants. Scientists claim to have taken a major step towards recreating the woolly mammoth by inserting more than a dozen of the creature's genes into the live DNA of an elephant. Researchers studied the structure of DNA from mammoths preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal\u2019s genes. These were then integrated by experts at Harvard University in Massachusetts into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal DNA. A new method known as 'Crispr' - helping scientists make accurate changes to DNA - was used by genetics professor George Church, who replaced parts of elephant DNA with the mammoth genes. Other researchers have proposed using mammoth DNA to replace that of an elephant using a similar technique to the one used to clone Dolly the Sheep. However, many scientists fear these animals would be unable to survive in the modern world without their ancient habitat. Such techniques also can lead to deformities and health problems in the animals. However the researchers behind the genetic analysis have urged other scientists not to attempt this for fear of the suffering it may cause to the animals. Instead, they say their findings have revealed new insights into the evolutionary history and demise of the woolly mammoths. They have published full DNA sequences of one mammoth found in Oimyakon, northeast Siberia \u2013 thought to be around 45,000 years old \u2013 and another from one of the last surviving mammoths found on Wrangel Island, north of Russia in the Arctic Ocean. They found that the mammoths on Wrangel Island had been isolated for at least 5,000 years, eking out a meager existence there before dying out 4,500 years ago.

The exact cause of Friday's blast is under investigation, Mims said, but it happened at the spot where a county worker was operating a front loader. The explosion sparked a fire that roared like a jet engine, Mims said. The operator of the front loader was injured but able to walk to an ambulance, the sheriff said. The most serious injuries were suffered by a group of inmates who were assigned to maintenance and cleaning work at the sheriff's firing range. There were 10 inmates near the blast site who were also injured, officials said. Three other inmates at the site were not hurt. Earlier, the sheriff's office included them in the injury count. After the blast, Mims said, two sheriff's deputies who were at the firing range ran toward the fire to move the injured. CNN affiliate KFSN posted a video of the scene that shows a tall ball of fire rising from near a highway. One inmate was airlifted to the hospital, the sheriff said. That inmate and the county worker were undergoing emergency surgery, she said. The others suffered mostly burns.

The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.  Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him \u2014 and Arkansas Gov.  Asa Hutchinson, and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. Pence: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.'

I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy.

Registry records show there is no mortgage on the couple\u2019s new home. Ms Forbes and Mr Clempson moved into her new-build house with their children, Lily, 19, and Sam, 16, in February. Neighbours have expressed mixed views about the house, which was completed this year after a two-year build. It replaced a red-brick mansion with a neo-classical facade that was torn down by the previous owners. Although the architects said they designed the new yellow-brick house to blend in with other Victorian and Georgian townhouses in the conservation area, some residents complain that it \u2018just sticks out\u2019.

It took 177 fire engines and 829 firefighters to bring the blaze under control, officials said. Residents are evacuated from their home in a village close to the fire at the chemical plant. The plant manufactures paraxylene, or PX, a chemical used for producing fibers and plastics. Exposure to the chemical can cause eye, nose and throat irritation. There have been several protests against the chemical plants in China in recent years. Authorities told The People's Daily Online that an oil leak at the plant had caught fire, leading to the explosion of three oil storage tanks at Tenglong Aromatic Hydrocarbon (Zhangzhou) Co. Ltd. on the Gulei Peninsula in Zhangzhou City. Environmental officials are monitoring the surrounding area for signs of contamination. The blaze could be seen for miles, with reports that tremors from the explosion were felt 30 miles away. The plant produces paraxylene, or PX, a chemical used for producing fibers and plastics.

The plasma is attracted to the magnetic fields and condenses, slowly falling back to the solar surface over several hours. Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), illustrated below, was launched on 11 February 2010 and has observed the sun ever since. It's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around Earth.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: The panel that cleared Inverness defender Josh Meekings to play in the William Hill Scottish Cup final did not even consider his handball, the Scottish Football Association has revealed. Meekings saw his cup-final ban thrown out by a judicial panel tribunal on Thursday after Caley Thistle challenged his one-game suspension for denying Celtic an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberate handball. And it has emerged the Highland club's lawyers successfully argued that SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan had no right to bring the case because match officials had seen the incident where Meekings stopped a Leigh Griffiths header during his side's 3-2 win over Celtic on Sunday. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time. The SFA published the reasons given by the chair of the three-man panel. They read: 'Further to the judicial panel hearing yesterday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings' solicitor. 'In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. 'The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory. 'It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.' The decision could effectively blunt the SFA's powers to bring retrospective cases against players, unless an incident has been completely missed by all match officials. Players have previously been cited for diving to win penalties. The rule states that the compliance officer can bring cases for alleged sending-off offences 'not seen by match officials'. The Meekings case was brought because referee Steven McLean and his team had not seen the ball hit the defender's hand.

The real-life tomb raiders began their daring plan by renting a restaurant across the road from Guanghui Temple in Zhengdin County, North China at the start of February. And while serving snacks to the public at the front of the building, a team on the inside was hard at work with shovels, ladders, and power drills - digging their way towards the temple's famous Hua Pagoda. Audacious plot: A seven-metre deep tunnel, which led to a 50m-long underground passage, was discovered by police when they raided the gang's property - across the road from\u00a0Guanghui Temple. Historical site: The temple dates back to the\u00a0Tang Dynasty and the Hua Pagoda (pictured) is nationally protected. The Criminal Investigation Bureau was tipped off about the group's audacious plan at the beginning of March and a task force was assigned to the case, reports People's Daily Online. After two days of investigation, police officers located the tunnel and were able to determine its source. They launched a sting operation four days later and five gang members were arrested - all of who confessed to plans to steal artefacts beneath the pagoda. The gang was just 20 metres away from breaching the Hua Pagoda when they were caught. Evidence of plan: Dozens of bags of earth dug up by the gang during their tunnelling were also found by police. Police questioning revealed that the gang's leader is a man named Zhang from Tianjin, North China.

It all started with a birthday party that little Damani Terry was attending. During the family gathering, he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a GMC van, according to Milwaukee police. The distraught driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, immediately stopped and got out to tend to the boy. But it was too late, police said. Damani was dead. Damani's alarmed family came running, including his older brother, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, police said. That was not the end of the situation. Soon, two more people would also die: the driver and the teen were both felled by bullets fired by the same man, police said. That man, identified as Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, was located late Wednesday at a Chicago-area hotel. He committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn told reporters. \"Chicago police and United States Marshals Service entered the hotel room, whereupon Mr. Chiles took his own life with his firearm,\" the police chief said Thursday. An accidental death, a fatal retaliation rips apart two families.

He issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate in 2012. The 43-year-old, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, had suffered years of persistent headaches, nausea and chronic fatigue, which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits. Mr Payne\u2019s warning came days after the Daily Mail revealed how the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes had sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years.

The offer comes as pension reforms give over-55s access to billions of pounds from today to withdraw from their pension pots and spend as they like. Tens of thousands of savers are being tempted to put their money into property \u2013 and this surge of \u2018silver landlords\u2019 is likely to push up house prices. Nationwide Building Society is giving anyone up to the age of 70 the chance to take out a 35-year loan, meaning some pensioners\u00a0are being offered mortgages that will only be paid off when they are 105 (file picture, posed) Traditionally, banks have been reluctant to allow borrowing beyond retirement, but now other lenders are considering raising their age limits too. Savers who want to put their money towards buy-to-let properties are unlikely to be able to afford to purchase a house outright, with the average price standing at \u00a3273,000. The option of taking out a mortgage to cover the shortfall has previously been unavailable as banks prefer people to repay before turning 70 or 75. But unlike residential mortgages, funded by income likely to fall away in retirement, a buy-to-let mortgage is funded by rental income, which does not cease when the owner retires. Economists say the increase in silver landlords competing to buy properties is boosting house prices, which are increasing at 8.4 per cent a year. Three in four of Britain\u2019s 2million landlords regard their property as their pension, according to research from financial consultancy BDRC. About one in five homes in Britain are owned by private landlords, and this is expected to rise to one in three by 2032, Government figures suggest. But there are perils too. The buy-to-let boom expected to follow today\u2019s changes could have painful tax consequences for some, experts warn. Withdrawing large sums from a pension pot will trigger a hefty income tax bill \u2013 for example, taking out \u00a3150,000 will produce a \u00a340,000 demand from HMRC.

Engulfed: Smoke and flames loom over the Prado Dam Flood Control Basin behind homes on Cheyenne Road in Corona, California. Damage: The fire threatened hundreds of homes near the Southern California dam. Rescue efforts were helped by cooperative weather combined with hundreds of firefighters who beat back the flames Sunday. Captain Mike Mohler of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire burned in the Prado Dam Flood Control Basin, where vegetation has not burned in decades. As a result, the area that is burning has up to 3 feet of 'duff' \u2014 needles, leaves and other combustible plant debris. At the same time, California's drought means the basin has not held much water recently, Mohler said. Because the smoke was not blowing away, area residents were urged to stay indoors. But the evacuation orders were lifted just before dawn Sunday. CalFire Captain Liz Brown confirmed that about 500 firefighters worked on the front lines.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: A gel made from patients' own blood could help heal burns more quickly - and stop wounds getting worse. The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components. Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing. U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns. Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'. U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection. The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury. This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn. Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic procedures. This is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts. It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate.

Hull defender McShane is keeping faith that the Tigers will avoid relegation despite a tough run of games. Hull have only scored twice in their last six away games in the league. Stranger still when you consider their final seven games include fixtures against Southampton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United.

The terrorist group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for Monday's attack, which occurred about 8 a.m. in the administrative capital of the autonomous Puntland region, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia. Four of the victims were foreigners and two were Somalis, said Ahmed Abdullahi Samatar, the police chief of Puntland. UNICEF, the U.N. aid agency focused on children, said it employed four of the dead. Four other workers were in serious condition, the agency said. The bomb went off as a vehicle was taking workers from their guest house to their office. The local police chief said the bomber was inside the vehicle among the U.N. staff. The bomber also died in the attack, according to authorities.

Thermal images show copper inside the battery reaching temperatures of at least 1,085\u00b0C (1,985\u00b0F) causing jets of molten material to burst from its vent. Scroll down for video.

Copper inside melted, indicating temperatures of at least 1,085\u00b0C (1,985\u00b0F), and it caused molten material to stream from the vent (pictured) The footage is the first time the failure of Li-ion batteries due to overheating has been recorded. It was filmed by Paul Shearing  from University College London and the findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. Li-ion batteries are vulnerable to a condition known as thermal runaway, which occurs when the rate of heat generation is greater than the rate of heat lost. Although battery failure is rare, prevention of thermal runaway presents one of the greatest challenges for the safe operation of lithium-ion batteries. Dr Shearing and his colleagues subjected two commercial Li-ion batteries, known as Cell 1 and Cell 2, to external heat. They then used thermal imaging and non-invasive high speed imaging techniques to observe the internal structure of each.

Truckers from Bulgaria, Poland and Romania who already work in the UK are being offered \u00a3100 by employment agency Mainline (pictured)\u00a0to lure drivers from their home country to work in Britain. The company did try a recruitment drive to attract lorry drivers from Cornwall to their base in Swindon. But they say they were forced to look further afield when that scheme failed. This is despite there being 3,000 jobless residents in Swindon. Around 4.5 per cent are also unemployed across the south west. The vacancy crisis will re-ignite claims that Britain\u2019s generous welfare system has created a generation unwilling to work, while acting as a magnet for foreigners. Debbie Jameson, from Mainline, said those who arrive from Eastern Europe are willing to work 'as many hours as they can' - something which she said British workers are less keen to do. She said: 'We don't just recruit drivers, we also recruit for permanent roles, call centre roles, industrial roles - everything. 'But it's mainly the skilled workers which we've been struggling to recruit. Numbers of HGV drivers have been dwindling over the years for various reasons.' Ms Jameson said one of the deterrents is the \u00a32,000 outlay that is needed to get a lorry-driving licence. She said many still struggle to get jobs after that, because they are newly qualified drivers and do not have any experience. Mainline said it will offer to help workers from overseas find accommodation and settle into a new life in the UK.

Police have released images of an unidentified man they are trying to trace to help them rescue a young girl who is believed to be being abused. The FBI confirmed it found images of a 'pre-pubescent blonde girl' that appear to show her being sexually abused, which could have been taken 'in America or elsewhere.' Officials said one picture, which does not show any abuse taking place, features the unidentified man posing with her. They said they are trying to trace the man - referred to as John Doe 29 - because they believe he may have 'critical information' to help them identify the victim and her whereabouts to rescue her. Investigators stressed the dark-haired man, believed to be between the ages of 30 and 45, is not suspected of carrying out abuse. Amanda Strickland, special investigator at the FBI, said: 'We are trying to stop further continued abuse of this child. We believe that it is still ongoing.' Police said the child was seen in one of the photographs wearing blue and white Nike velcro sneakers. They confirmed John Doe 29 has a tan complexion and was pictured wearing a silver ring on his left hand ring fingers. Other pictures appear to show a different hand with a ring on the right hand. Initial images of the unidentified adult male, John Doe 29, shown with a child were first recorded by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in January of 2008. The pictures have been recently re-enhanced to try and identify the mystery man. The FBI released the appeal, with images of John Doe 29, and distinguishing features in a bid to get information. He is being sought as part of the FBI\u2019s Operation Rescue Me and Endangered Child Alert Program (ECAP) initiatives which aim to find abuse victims. The FBI has released a poster and blog appealing for any information about the man. People are asked to submit a tip online at tips.fbi.gov or call the FBI\u2019s toll-free tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI. Investigators said a collection of photos were found showing the girl being abused, but in one which did not feature abuse John Doe is seen posing with the girl, and there is a close up of his hand (left).

Bedene's switch in nationality has been met by criticism in some quarters, but not from Rusedski, who himself moved from Canada to represent Great Britain in 1995. World 99 Aljaz Bedene is not giving up hope in his quest to play for Great Britain in the Davis Cup. Bedene has Greg Rusedski's support in his bid to overturn the ITF's ruling that he can't play for Great Britain. Rusedski said: 'Every time you get another player in the top 100 it can only be of benefit and I think he will help push and drive other players to get ahead of him. 'At the moment when it comes to the Davis Cup he doesn't even factor into the discussion unless he gets the ITF to overturn their current ruling. 'But I think if the ITF do change their ruling and allow him to become available then it will be a good thing for the game in this country.' Bedene is currently ranked 99 in the world, making him British No 2 behind Andy Murray and ahead of James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady. Rusedski has some experience of where Bedene is coming from after turning to Team GB from Canada. Great Britain's No 1 Andy Murray backs Bedene's bid, saying it'd prove motivational for those below him. Murray has already backed Bedene's switch of nationality, saying: 'I would hope that all the guys that are below him now will use it as motivation.' Bedene's case with the ITF is based on the fact that his citizenship was already pending when the governing body amended its own rules on the subject earlier this year.

Jenkins was jailed exactly one year ago for shooting dead four people in 10 days after being released from prison. During his murder trial in Douglas County, Jenkins was assessed by a doctor who concluded that he was 'a psychopath' and 'one of the most dangerous people' he had ever encountered. 'Psychopath': The 28-year-old, who a doctor described as 'one of the most dangerous people' he had ever encountered, may use the botched case of self-mutilation as evidence he is mentally unstable.

Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February. Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Gorkha, Nepal (CNN)The ride from Kathmandu to near the epicenter of Nepal's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick. Steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where Nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured, in much less than ideal circumstances. The view along the six-hour journey from the capital is deceptive. Although I see numerous landslides, I am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected. During the entire journey, I notice only about 10 collapsed or seriously damaged houses. One of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in Nepal is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas. One of them is Gorkha, a district northwest of Kathmandu. The town we were visiting looks intact. Some houses have cracks, and I see a few collapsed brick walls. Most of the shops and businesses are open. But our first stop at the district hospital brings us into the full reality of the human catastrophe. The hospital campus is overflowing with patients. The facility is simply not big enough to handle such calamity. The injured are not from the town of Gorkha, which lies near the top of one of the numerous mountain ranges. They are from northern part of the district, where some 200,000 people live. To accommodate all the casualties, the hospital built a tarpaulin shelter over the parking lot. At a time of our arrival, there are about 20 patients lying on mattresses on a dusty concrete floor. The youngest is 10, the oldest in his 70s. Most of them have visible wounds: deep cuts, bruised faces, broken arms and legs or spinal injuries. All of their faces with empty looks are still expressing the terror they went through and the pain they are suffering. Mita Gurung, 10, sustained injuries to her face and leg when her house in the village of Sinjung partially collapsed. Her mother was injured in the tremor. Mita is gently tended by volunteer child counselor Tara May Bishakarma. \"I just found what she likes and keep repeating it. Her injuries are fairly superficial, but she is traumatized. It will take some time, but she will recover,\" Bishakarma says. Children usually get excited when being filmed. Mita seems almost unaware of my camera.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Attorneys for two sides agree that in April 1995, a 24-year-old man who had been pointed out by a Southern California college student as her rapist had his truck rear-ended before he was kidnapped, brutally beaten and killed. Where they differ is on the role of now-45-year-old Gianni Van in the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez, whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of a road. At the opening of his trial Wednesday, prosecutors said Van was enraged after his ex-girlfriend Norma Patricia Esparza told him Ramirez had raped her and he must be held responsible for the attack. She's expected to testify Thursday. Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of\u00a0f Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver. Van's lawyer said his client had no knowledge of the plan to harm Ramirez and was threatened that he would suffer a similar fate if he snitched on a friend and friend's employee who carried out the killing. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza \u2014 who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France \u2014 was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from sexual assault victim advocates who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. During opening statements, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). Esparza and Van allegedly entered into a sham marriage before Van's original arrest for the crime. Esparza could not be forced to testify and Van was released. They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in France and the mother of a little girl. Arrested: In 2012, Esparza was arrested in connection to the slaying when she re-entered the United States for an academic conference.

Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from her local Sainsbury\u2019s store in Coventry when she threw the used cigarette on the ground - before two council officers came \u2018sprinting\u2019 towards her to say she had committed a criminal offence.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)UltraHaptics is a young company with a big dream: changing the way we interact with electronic devices. Their technology creates tactile three-dimensional shapes literally out of thin air, using ultrasound. The company's tagline says it all: \"Feeling without touching.\" Through an emission of sound waves, sensations are projected through the air and to the user. Changes in air pressure are perceived as suspended tactile surfaces, creating invisible -- but tangible -- interfaces. This already sounds quite intriguing, but paired with another rising technology it has the potential to become a game changer. The rising tide of virtual reality seems unstoppable: Facebook's Oculus Rift and Magic Leap are leading the pack, but several other companies are readying devices in a field that could shake the foundations of electronic entertainment. But even though it is incredibly convincing, virtual reality completely bypasses the sense of touch: applying UltraHaptics' technology to it would allow users to not just see the virtual world projected in front of their eyes, but to touch it as well. Tom Carter, UltraHaptics' CTO, sees potential in the merging of these technologies: \"The ability to put on your virtual reality goggles and not just explore visually and through your headphones, but also touch what you can see, is a really exciting possibility,\" he told CNN's Nick Glass. Creating buttons and shapes literally anywhere they're needed opens up a slew of possibilities for more traditional devices as well. \"Imagine the dashboard of a car having no buttons, no switches, no ugly controls: just a very nice, sleek dashboard. \"If you're driving and you want to have the music up for example, you don't have to take your eyes off the road, you just hold your hand out and the controls stick to your hand, so you can feel them.\" Smartphones and other popular devices could also see benefits: controlling appliances in the kitchen, using TVs and computers in a style reminiscent of the movie \"Minority report\", or even snoozing the alarm in the morning would all become just a matter of waving your hands. (This probably wouldn't be the most virtuous application of the technology.) Several devices can already be controlled with gestures, but UltraHaptics add an extra layer of feedback, by generating the sensation of a force field: \"Haptics is more than just the sense of touch. It's really all of the information that you get from the sense of touch.

Kane moved to within two strikes of the 30-goal barrier for the season after scoring on his full international debut some 79 seconds after coming on against Lithuania at Wembley last Friday night. England boss Roy Hodgson is mindful of keeping expectations in check for Kane, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise after finally breaking into the Spurs first-team following loan spells at the likes of Leicester and Norwich.

Pochettino has said he will be there to help Kane when things are not going to plan for him. Pochettino (right) played alongside Batistuta with the Argentina international team. Former Argentina international Pochettino knows lows can come just as quickly as highs, so will be ready to offer Kane advice whenever it is needed.

The challenge is doing it all again next season,' said Pochettino, who faced England in the 2002 World Cup finals in the same team as the renowned Argentina forward. 'Now it is up to him. Harry knows the way to improve his ability. He is in a very good moment to keep working hard and develop his game. 'You need to wait for the right moment to give a player the responsibility because sometimes we can see a player is ready, but not quite complete to assume the responsibility and keep the same level.

'It is not easy when the player goes down, this is our challenge, but not only with Harry, with all players. 'There may be people who doubt him about next season, but the people that know him understand, like us, know that Harry can keep the level he has shown.'

Barcelona forward Pedro could join Liverpool this summer if Raheem Sterling leaves Anfield. Sterling, pictured in action against Arsenal, has rejected a new \u00a3100,000-a-week deal with Liverpool. Pedro, pictured celebrating a goal against Elche, would command wages of \u00a390,000-a-week. If that price does not deter Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal or Real Madrid then Pedro, who has been looked at before by Brendan Rodgers, would become a realistic target for Liverpool. The two-times Champions League winner is set to start for Barcelona on Wednesday night against Almeria but only so that Neymar or Luis Suarez can be rested ahead of a vital away trip to Sevilla at the weekend. Pedro is believed to be tired of being the fourth man in Barcelona's all-star three-man attack and Inter Milan and Bayern Munich have also shown an interest in him. Joining his former manager Pep Guardiola at Bayern would leave Pedro with the same difficulty when it came to getting into the first team that he encounters at Barcelona, while Inter would not be able to match Liverpool in terms of wages. Sterling has attracted interest from Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Pedro has spent much of the season on the bench with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez starting games.

But now Bon Apetit has\u00a0come up with a genius way to revive your stale loaf and it involves running it under the tap. And whilst it might sound like an unusual move, they promise that this trick will revive your crusty old bread before dinner time. Bon Apetit have revealed that the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread is to run it under water before baking it in the oven. The first step they suggest is to take your stale bread and run it under your tap. It doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold but you should try to keep the cut edge away from the direct flow of water. Then turn your oven on to a warm temperature - around 150 degrees - and stick the bread inside. For a small loaf you need to allow around 6-7 minutes and for a large, or particularly wet one, around 12 to 13 minutes. The experts say it works because: 'The water turns to steam, which rehydrates the bread\u2019s crumb, or interior, while the heat of the oven firms up the crust.' When you have wet your bread put it in the oven for between 6 and 13 minutes depending on how large and how wet the loaf is. Femail spoke to Lifesum nutritionist Luvisa Nilsson who said that the water trick does actually work, but you must make sure to eat the bread that same day. 'Whilst there might not be any obvious health risks whilst using the water\/heat method, it is beneficial not to waste food,' she said.' 'Once you have put your \u2018watered\u2019 bread in the oven or microwave, make sure you eat it within the day, as the warmth and damp may potentially harbour bacteria. Nutritionist Luvisa Nillson says that you should be careful to check that your bread is not mouldy and make sure to eat it within one day. She continued: 'There is however a difference between stale and mouldy bread, and you must watch out for mould. 'Bread should be disposed off if it has orange, green, yellow or black spots as these can be harmful to your gut and cause severe discomfort and stomach ache. 'When bread goes stale it is usually a good sign that It is about to go mouldy, so give the bread a thorough check before consuming.'\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

A busy working week can take its toll on our lives, leaving little time to plan our meals. From breakfast at the desk to the mid-afternoon slump, the temptation to take short cuts and grab the nearest pick me up is too much to resist. With so many products claiming to be 'healthy', it can be a real struggle to know what to pick from the shelves of your nearest high street shop. And lurking inside many seemingly 'healthy' foods, are hidden ingredients that may be wreaking havoc with your teeth. Now, Dr Sameer Patel, clinical director at the Elleven practice in London's Harley Street, has highlighted the dentistry dangers of the 'desk diet'. Here, he reveals the biggest offenders, and offers advice on how to safeguard your oral health during the working day. BREAKFAST. Dental Danger. Some breakfast cereals can contain as much as three teaspoons of sugar per serving \u2013 this is around two and a half chocolate biscuits. Inconsistent labelling means that even the 'healthier' brands can also be culprits and choices such as muesli can be surprisingly high in sugars. Solution. There is a way around this. Opt for low sugar options such as wheat biscuits or unsweetened porridge oats and if you need something to sweeten the taste go for honey or crunchy fruit. Eating your cereal with dairy products can also counteract the damage caused by sugar and have added benefits for your oral health. The calcium, phosphates and vitamin D in milk provides important minerals which can help improve the health of your teeth by strengthening and de-mineralising their structure. Probiotic yoghurt can also help decrease bad bacteria in the mouth which in turn limits tooth decay and helps to promote a healthy mouth environment. HOT DRINKS. Dental Danger. Coffee and tea are notorious for staining in between teeth and if drunk regularly, the staining, tannin compounds can build up and cause teeth to turn yellow. Regular consumption can also lead to bad breath, which is down to mouth dehydration. Caffeine is a diuretic and therefore dries out the mouth, counteracting the internal rinsing that normally occurs and causing bacteria to multiply. Solution. 'The best way to avoid this is to rinse the mouth with water after consumption, to wash away the tannins and rehydrate the mouth.

Set up as a refugee camp for Palestinians in the 1950s, it slowly evolved into a neighborhood over the years, but since 2012 it has been engulfed in the Syrian conflict. Two weeks ago ISIS fighters stormed Yarmouk, and that made life for those still inside even worse than it was before. The Syrian government responded by unleashing a bombing and shelling campaign on the area, residents told CNN, including barrel bombs that flattened many of the buildings already scarred by the three-year-long conflict. Death comes day and night. \"I looked up and saw dust,\" one resident said. \"I opened the door and started walking outside and started shouting to the neighbors. One told me 'I am wounded,' another one didn't answer me at all. That second one -- may god have mercy on his soul -- he was martyred.\" While the battle for Yarmouk is very typical of Syria's civil war, the conflict here is unique. Most of those fighting on all sides are Palestinians. Pro-government factions besiege the area from the outside, cutting off supplies and aid most of the time. The inside is held by anti-regime groups, some of which are Islamists. The situation in Yarmouk was thrust in to the headlines on April 1 when ISIS fighters stormed the rebel-held area and unleashed a campaign of violence and killings. Since then, a local activist tells CNN, ISIS has withdrawn to another area and left the al Qaedalinked group Jabhat al-Nusra in charge of the district.

And one of the companies in the 12 Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextStep) says they have an engine that could get humans to Mars in just 39 days. Scroll down for video. Nasa has selected a variety of companies to work on projects to create advanced space technologies, including a faster method of propulsion known as Vasimr (illustrated), which could apparently get to Mars in a matter of weeks, not months. The Vasimr engine - which uses plasma as a propellant - is being developed by the Ad Astra Rocket company in Texas. Their engine shot to fame a few years ago when it was revealed that it could drastically reduce the journey time to Mars from months to weeks - although it may require a nuclear power source. And following the successful test of a prototype in 2013, it seems Nasa is now considering it for use on a future mission to Mars. Short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, Vasimr works with plasma, an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field also insulates nearby structures so exhaust temperatures well beyond the melting point of materials can be achieved. In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low. \u2018We are thrilled by this announcement and proud to be joining forces with Nasa in the final steps of the technology maturation,\u2019 said Dr Franklin Chang Diaz, Ad Astra\u2019s Chairman and CEO, in a statement. \u2018We look forward to a very successful partnership as we jointly advance the technology to flight readiness.\u2019 Over three years, Nasa will give the company about \u00a36.8 million ($10 million) to get the engine almost ready to fly in space.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: A rare black flamingo amazed bird watchers when it was spotted feeding among a group of the traditionally pink birds in Cyprus. The migratory bird was spotted at a salt lake near the British RAF base at Akrotiri on the island's south coast close to the resort city of Limassol. Normally, the graceful birds have a pink hue caused by the levels of beto-Carotene in their diet. Scroll down for video. Ruffling feathers: The unusual black flamingo was spotted near the coastal city of Limassol on Cyprus by birdwatchers. Alexia Perdiou, the base's assistant environment officer, said it could be one-of-a-kind. 'Of course we are all very excited because we believe it could be the only flamingo of its kind in the world and very little is known about it,' she said. 'We are expecting a lot of visitors over the next few days.' A black flamingo was reportedly last spotted in Israel in 2014 and aside from its colour, it is no different to the hundreds of pink flamingos which flock to the salt lakes of Cyprus every spring. Experts believe a rare genetic irregularity known as \"melanism\" can generate more melanin than usual, turning a flamingo's feathers a dark colour. Migrating: The bird looked very healthy despite its unusual hue and is believed to be heading to Turkey to breed. Martin Hellicar of the conservation group BirdLife Cyprus said the black-coloured flamingo was not unique, though acknowledged they were uncommon in the Mediterranean. He said it was probably migrating to its breeding area in Turkey after spending the winter elsewhere.\u00a0He added that the flamingo stopped on its journey in the salt lake to feed on brine shrimp.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

The latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic River Walbrook, in London, has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony. When about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a Roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise. Scroll down for video. New find: Around seven human skulls (pictured) dating back nearly 2,000 years have so far been found as part of the latest discovery by archaeologists at the London Crossrail site near Liverpool Street station. Roman rummaging: One of the skulls (left) was uncovered next to a Roman road which has also been found. A piece of Roman figurative pottery (right) was also dug up during searches of the site. Digging for history: A cross-section of the Roman roadside ditch uncovered at Liverpool Street station. The estimated age of the human remains and the way they appear to have been disposed of has led to the suggestion that the bones could even be Boudicca's rebels. Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of  executed criminals and rebels. A spokesman for London Crossrail confirmed the team was working up a number of theories. He said: 'We don't have any answers yet but we are looking into it.' The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives.

A Hungarian man has been convicted of luring young, gay Eastern European men to the United States for a horrific life of sex slavery. Andras Janos Vass, 25, was found guilty of human trafficking and racketeering felonies this week after grooming fellow Hungarians online then keeping them captive in New York City and Miami. Vass brought men to America with the promises of easy work and high wages - then took their travel documents, threatened their families, and made them spend 20 hours a day on sex work, prosecutors said. He was found guilty of the offences by a jury in Miami-Dade on Thursday, the Miami Herald reported. He faces a maximum sentence of 155 years in prison - and will spend at least 21 behind bars. Three of Vass's victims testified against him at the trial. Two said they were tempted to the United States after being contacted via Planet Romeo, a free dating site. According Gay Star News, the men believed they would be employed as legal escorts and make between $3,000 and $5,000 a month. The victims said they were flown to New York City in 2012 and forced to live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment. They were forced to perform sex work at all hours, either in person or live on webcams. Lure: Prosecutors said at least two of the victims were lured to America via the Planet Romeo gay dating website. According to online listings, Vass's company, Never Sleep Inc., was based at an address in Sunset Park, Brooklyn in New York City. In August 2012, prosecutors said, the Vass and his associates moved the business to Miami. Vass is accused of running the sex ring with two other men, Gabor Acs and Viktor Berki, who have yet to stand trial. Victims said that they had their passports taken when they arrived and that Berki, a former policeman, threatened their families in Hungary. Vass is due to be sentenced on June 2.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Ruse awakening: The Reddit thread asked users to spill the beans on what'surprised' them the most when they started living with their spouses. One user described the process of 'ordering' a bride from Russia or the Philippines, where thousands of women are desperate to start a new life for themselves in Europe and the US. The fee to find a bride this way, according to this user, costs between $10,000 (\u00a36,500) and $15,000 (\u00a39,800), although others have said they paid as much as $50,000 (\u00a332,700).

The drone was able to fly around the zoo - before arriving at the chimp enclosure.

In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK.

The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the \u00a346billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis.

After gay rights activists, sympathetic businesses and celebrities thrust the measures into the national spotlight, both states found themselves in the cross-hairs, and even Republican lawmakers began to distance themselves from the laws as written. Republican leaders in the Hoosier State conceded this week to critics arguing that their state's law, signed into effect by Governor Mike Pence a week ago today, inadvertently left room for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'It was never intended to discriminate against anyone,' Indiana Senate President Pro Tem David Long said this morning at a press conference.

China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance after the fourth massive sandstorm struck the north-west of the country this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to\u00a0The People's Daily Online. The raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live. The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards. China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country. China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) has now issued a blue alert for the latest sandstorms to hit the northern regions. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi, in what was the fourth sandstorm to hit the area this year. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. Police spokesman Hui Chuang said: 'The storm forced most people to stay indoors because it was difficult to drive anyway given the low visibility and also hard to breathe without inhaling sand. 'It also forced the closure of the nearby Mogao Grottoes.' The site is a UNESCO world heritage tourist site renowned for its massive sculptures and frescoes carved in caves along a cliff. Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city yesterday. Traffic was brought to a standstill and residents fled for cover when the storm hit. Two local government officers attempt to sweep the sand off the city's pavements.

The 36-year-old publican told Torquay Magistrates' Court that the last thing he could remember was going to bed at approximately 12.30am and then awoke beside his car which had been involved in a car crash. James Boase, pictured, failed to stop after hitting another car on March 13, 2014 near his Devon pub, pictured. Mr Boase claimed that he went to bed around 12.30am and must have been sleep walking. He insisted he had been'sleep walking'. However prosecutors insisted he had failed to stop his black Nissan Navara after being involved in a collision with a Citroen Berlingo. Police arrived at Boase's house where they found him standing next to his car. He told the court: 'I remember being confused and slightly frustrated.I honestly don\u2019t know how I got there.

The court heard how Boase had 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than double the legal limit. At Torquay Magistrates' Court, District Judge Kevin Grey dismissed Boase\u2019s claims of sleepwalking and found him guilty of drink-driving, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving dangerously. Boase has been remanded on unconditional bail until May 12 for a pre-sentence report, and was disqualified from driving in the meantime.

If Roy Hodgson\u2019s star names moved to Bayern Munich or Barcelona, would the FA tell him not to pick them? Absolutely not. The same needs to apply to rugby.

The World Cup is simply about the world\u2019s best coming together and ridiculous rules like this demean it. Toulon\u2019s Steffon Armitage came off the bench against Leinster on Sunday and turned the game on its head. His turnover work and ball-carrying are second to none and since he upped sticks to France his game has constantly improved. Toulon's Steffon Armitage takes on the Leinster defence during the Champions Cup semi-final in Marseille. I don\u2019t think Armitage would be playing this well if he was still at London Irish. He took a big risk and it paid off, he shouldn\u2019t be penalised for it. If one or two England back-rowers wouldn\u2019t want to see Armitage in the squad, then that confirms he should be! Nick Abendanon has also become better since he crossed the Channel. It\u2019s simply wrong to say England are best served by players at English clubs. If someone is going to be happier, healthier and a better player overseas, he should be supported. Jonny Wilkinson moved to France and became even better than when he played for England, so that completes the argument for me. Would I have picked Jonny if he was playing in France? Of course I would. Nick Abendanon's game has drastically improved since the former Bath full back made the move to France.

A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick the more likely its residents were to want a job.\u00a0In Norway, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80% of people wanted a job.

By contrast in Estonia, one of the least generous countries, only around 40 per cent did. The survey was carried out by sociologists Dr Kjetil van der Wel and Dr Knut Halvorsen from Oslo and Akershus University College. They examined responses to the statement: 'I would enjoy having a paid job even if I did not need the money' put to the interviewees for the European Social Survey in 2010. People who are hungry are more inclined to support of the welfare state policies that help the poor. The extraordinary results of a recent study from Aarhus University found that the state of our bodies has a significant influence on our position on specific political issues. Researchers said people's support for apparently altruistic policies of wealth redistribution is not so much a reflection of concern for the poor but 'rather a strategy for securing further resources for themselves.' And they their findings could revolutionise perceptions of how people come to adopt a political stance, with our ideological views apparently swayed by basic biology. These responses were then compared with the amount the countries spent on welfare benefits and employment schemes, while taking into account the population differences between the member states. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits, which was reflected in the percentage of people agreeing with the statement at almost 60 per cent. The researchers also found that governments that intervene  to help the unemployed find work made people in general more likely to agree that they wanted work even if they didn't need the money.

It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Europe has been urged to copy Australia's military-led'stop the boats' policy to avoid migrant tragedies in the Mediterranean. Australian PM Tony Abbott \u2013 who sends naval gunboats to turn back asylum seekers before they reach Australia \u2013 said the EU should 'urgently' follow his lead. His hardline policy has proved controversial but Mr Abbott said it was the only way to prevent disasters such as the loss of 900 lives when a fishing boat capsized on Saturday night. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths. Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania yesterday morning. Solemn: A young man, bows his head as he makes the short walk from the rescue boat's deck to the Catania shore where hundreds of people had gathered. New life: Members of the Italian Police look on as a migrant who survived the ship sinking off the coast of Libya walks the ramp of an Italian Coast Guard's vessel upon arrival at Catania's port yesterday morning. He said: 'The only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats. 'That's why it is so urgent that the countries of Europe adopt very strong policies that will end the people-smuggling trade across the Mediterranean.' Conservative Mr Abbott won power in 2013 on a'stop the boats' pledge, and not a single one has breached his ring of steel in 18 months. Operation Sovereign Borders involves the Australian Navy intercepting boats filled with migrants at sea, and either turning them back or towing them back to where they came from. Mr Abbott has previously said he was sick of being lectured to by the United Nations over Australia's obligations to refugees, saying his policy was the'most decent, most compassionate' solution. In the Mediterranean, callous people smugglers have been exploiting a willingness by European nations to rescue migrants rather than send them back. Last year, Italy scaled back its rescue operations because it feared they were only encouraging migrants to gamble with their lives. But the horrific loss of life over the past week in a spate of migrant shipwrecks has prompted calls to urgently reinstate the rescue missions. EU leaders including David Cameron are meeting tomorrow in what charities are calling a 'life or death' summit to solve the problem.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering \"a psychotic episode\" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence \"revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,\" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate.

PETA Australia has been petitioning The Just Group to reconsider their position after successfully getting other retailers, including David Jones, Myer, Sportsgirl, General Pants Co, and Jeanswest, to stop\u00a0selling\u00a0angora. 'I'm looking forward to my concerts at the Sydney Opera House in May, but I was extremely dismayed to learn from my friends at PETA Australia that The Just Group refuse to modernise and drop angora wool from their clothing lines', Morrissey writes.

The two sets of maps include image mosaics (right) and topographical views (right) of the lunar landscape. Darker blue show deep craters, while the grey and white areas reveal areas of elevation. Early theories claimed this mysterious region, roughly 1,600 miles (2,600km) across, was created by an asteroid impact. Last year, however, Nasa scientists proposed that the Ocean of Storms was in fact the result of the formation of ancient rift valleys. The feature is located on the surface of the moon's near side which is characterised by low elevations and numerous ancient volcanic plains. Scientists believe the rifts are buried beneath dark volcanic plains in this area, and so far, they have only been detected in the gravity data provided by the Grail probes. The map also shows Mare Orientale, an impact crater that was partially flooded by basalts. Shaped like a target ring bull's-eye, the Mare Orientale is one of the most striking large scale lunar features. Found on the moon's extreme western edge, it is difficult to see from an earthbound perspective. Pictured on the left is the moon's south pole, and on the right, the north pole.\u00a0To create the maps, more than 6.5 billion measurements were collected between 2009 and 2013 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Wide Angle Camera (Wac) and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Nasa's ultimate goal at the moment is to land humans on Mars by the 2030s. Exactly how to get there is up for debate, with the agency favouring a mission to an asteroid in the next decade, followed by a giant leap to the red planet the decade after. But one expert has claimed that Nasa is actually planning to go back to the moon first, as a waypoint to reaching its final goal.

But Issa, who wrote as chairman of the House committee on oversight and government reform, was ignored until more than a month after Clinton had stepped down in February 2013. And even then, the reply did not answer the question - instead going into detail over the State Department's email policy. Silence: Representative Darrell Issa (left) asked the State Department about the use of personal email for official business in December 2012, but didn't receive any answer until Clinton (right) had left the department. The leaked letter, obtained by the\u00a0New York Times, casts a further shadow over Clinton just days into her bid to become the Democrat's 2016 presidential candidate. The former First Lady found herself at the centre of a storm in recent months after it was revealed she used her personal address during her time as Secretary of State. Even her Twitter profile picture was dragged into the row: it showed her on her Blackberry apparently sending emails while en route to Libya in September 2011. But there is no record of any emails on her official account that day - and she has since removed the picture from her account. Clinton has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account, calling it a matter of 'convenience', admitting to deleting thousands of emails. Clinton, however, has insisted every relevant email was now in the hands of the State Department. But critics say by using her personal email account, she has avoided scrutiny. The presidential hopeful handed over 55,000 emails sent from her personal email account between 2009 and 2013 - her time as Secretary of State - but it is not yet known what they contained. However, it has already been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'. Shadow: Clinton is likely to want to play down this latest revelation as she begins campaigning in Iowa.

Andy Murray reacts as he reaches the Miami Open final with a win over Tomas Berdych in the last four. He will face long-time rival Novak Djokovic in the final in Miami on Sunday. Murray's fiancee Kim Sears watches on in the heat in Miami during his semi-final. He would dearly love to do so with the trophy in his luggage. For one, it would represent his biggest tournament win since taking the Wimbledon title in 2013, irrefutable proof that he is back towards his best. Perhaps even more importantly it would end the growing dominance of Djokovic over the Scot \u2014 and everyone else for that matter. Murray will need no reminding that he has lost nine out of his last 10 matches against the Serb, so it is a huge task. Even more remarkably, Djokovic has won his past nine finals at these Masters-level events, which are one tier down from the Grand Slams. Murray allowed himself to get befuddled by the world No1\u2019s histrionics in the Australian Open final, and then played a plain bad match when thrashed by him in their Indian Wells semi-final last month.

The case comes as the latest black eye for the troubled state prison system. The three men - Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, David Elliot Moran, 47, and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42 - were arrested Thursday and each faces one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office said in a written statement. The state said the murder plot started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center in rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate. Moran is currently a sergeant at that facility. Newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements, according to the department. Charged: (From left to right) Charles Thomas Newcomb, Thomas Jordan Driver, and David Elliot Moran each were arrested Thursday on one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office said. Bondi's office said the three were also members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group has garnered attention in recent months for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. The FBI was initially alerted to the murder plot by a confidential informant inside the Klan, according to an arrest affidavit. The FBI's affidavit described the informant as 'a confidential human source for the FBI whose motivation for cooperation with the FBI is patriotism.' The informant was present when Driver and Moran talked with Newcomb, identified as the KKK chapter's 'Exalted Cyclops' or leader, and recorded many of their conversations. In late 2014, authorities say Driver provided the Klan chapter, called a klavern, with a photograph of the inmate, who'd been let out on supervised release. 'Both Driver and Moran... told the (confidential informant) that they wanted (the inmate) \"six feet under,\"' the FBI's affidavit said. The informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate - ranging from shooting him to injecting with a lethal dose of insulin, which Newcomb said 'would be quieter.'\u00a0In the recordings, the men often refer to the man using a racial epithet.

For more than 40 years, its lyrics have been an enigma wrapped in an eight-and-a-half minute long rock 'n' roll puzzle. Argued over by generations of geeky fans, deciphered and re-deciphered by code-breaking rock nerds and considered to be poetic reflections on mid-20th century U.S. social history by even groovier academics, it's called American Pie. And this week its lyrics, hand-written in 1971 by a young folk singer called Don McLean, were sold at auction in New York for more than $1 million. That's a lot of money for 18 sheets of paper, albeit with a lost seventh verse. But, to be honest, I rather think that whoever bought them got a bargain. Because, in this age, when song lyrics have all but become meaningless, American Pie illustrates, in a series of images, metaphors and allusions, just what can be done within the frame of a melodically straightforward pop song. It's also a paean to education. McLean loves words, he says, 'almost as much as life'. That may be a slight overstatement, but it shows. Of course, like all poets, McLean didn't give us a key to the riddle of what his song was about when he released his multi-million-selling single. That would have spoiled it. 'It means I'll never have to work again,' he would joke about how much money the song had made him, leaving us to work out for ourselves what the'sad news on the doorstep' was exactly, and why he 'couldn't take one more step' when he read it. That was the easy part, of course, for anyone of my and his generation who learned about the death in a plane crash in 1959 of one of the first great singer-songwriters of rock, Buddy Holly, when we read about it in the morning newspaper. As McLean sings, it was truly 'The day the music died'. I was on a Ribble bus going to school in Lancashire, peering over the shoulder of the man in front of me when I saw the headline.

Police in Shanghai revealed today that they had seized three million knock-off condoms - thought to be worth nearly \u00a31.3 million on the black market - after they broke up a large operation covering eight provinces. Officers said the lubricating oil used on the condoms at one production line in Henan province was so disgusting that it made them feel sick, according to the\u00a0People's Daily Online. Dodgy work: Fake condoms were made in a makeshift workshop in Shanghai. Big haul: A total of three million condoms, thought to be worth \u00a31.3 million, were seized by police. Heavy metals are toxic metals such as mercury, lead and arsenic. However, officials did not reveal the exact metal traces found during the tests. The fakes were packaged as popular brands such as Durex and cost just 1p to make - 30 times less than the market value. Cheap raw materials - consisting of plastic strips and elastic bands - were used to make the condoms in makeshift workshops. But the gang still sold the condoms at the regular price of \u00a34.20 for a pack of 12 via their own online shop, contacting potential customers via social media. The counterfeit condoms were also sold at motels across the country. Squalid: The condoms were made by women in a run-down residential property in the Yangpu district. Health hazard: Tests found that the counterfeit condoms contained toxic metals and were not safe to use. One woman in the Yangpu district of Shanghai had been running a workshop in a run-down residential property, employing local workers to make and package the condoms. The woman, who had already been arrested in 2013 for selling fake Viagra, was arrested along with eight others. Zhang Wenliang, a police officer from Shanghai's Yangpu district Public Security Bureau, said: 'At a workshop in Henan province, we found a small production line which produced bad-quality condoms. The lubricating oil made us vomit. 'We sent the seized condoms to the quality authorities and tests showed they contained heavy metals. They are very dangerous to humans.' Police said the gang had nine production lines and warehouses across the country. The fake condoms were sold in Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shaanxi provinces. Not the real deal: The fakes were packaged as popular brands like Durex in the sophisticated operation.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)People have long underestimated the athleticism necessary for golf. But over the last decade, with fit golfers like Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, and now Jordan Spieth all winning the Masters, the training perspective on golf is shifting. There's a particular emphasis on the functional movement required to execute the perfect swing, which is why yoga is increasingly appealing to golfers. During the Masters, Spieth demonstrated optimal movement in two key areas that enhance swing power and fluid control while decreasing the risk of back and knee injuries: mid-back mobility and internal hip rotation. Equally important, he did it while maintaining a stable low back and integrated core strength as the foundation for expressing his swing mobility. Related: Yoga for triathletes. Remember Tiger Wood's low-back problem earlier this year? Tiger blamed a lack of glute (primary buttock muscle) firing for locking up his back, but attempting to rotate from his low back instead of moving functionally from his mid back or hips likely exacerbated the issue. When golfers have mobility limitations in their mid back or hips, they compensate with their low back and knees, which not only hampers play but often leads to pain and injury. Want the mobility to swing like Spieth and avoid the back and knee issues that commonly plague golfers? Try these three yoga-based moves I use with my PGA clients to address the key areas of the swing. Trains internal hip rotation; stabilizes and lengthens lower back muscles; stretches upper back and shoulders; encourages ankle mobility. Start in a neutral all-fours position with your hips over your knees and your shoulders above your wrists. Engage your deep core muscles to stabilize your low back. Extend your right leg straight out to the side with your toes pointing forward and the sole of your foot down. Exhale as you sit your hips back toward your heels as far as you can go comfortably without knee, hip or back pain. Inhale as you bring your body weight forward again and internally rotate from your right hip to come up onto your toes (as pictured). Be sure the rotation is coming from your hip, not your lower back, knees or ankles. Exhale and return your hips back towards your heels and the sole of your foot to the floor. Repeat the movement in synch with your breathing through five repetitions on each side.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Nurses forced to work 12-hour shifts amid staff shortages are treated like'slave labour', a union has claimed. With a growing demand for nurses to work long hours, Unison has called for more research into the effects of workers' health. At the union's healthcare conference in Liverpool this week, one member highlighted how staff at a hospital in Staffordshire are expected to work six long days a week, totalling up to 78 hours a week. Jane Smith told colleagues: 'The fact staff are so tired has a detrimental effect on patient care and (also) puts other staff at risk.' Nurses working 12-hour shifts amid staffing shortages in the NHS are treated like'slave labour', one Unison member has warned, as she called for more research into how longer working hours affect staff health. She said she was aware of one nurse who had worked 11 consecutive long day shifts, the Nursing Times reported. In a stretched NHS, longer shifts are now more common, offering a cost-effective strategy. In the past the working day was divided into three, eight-hour shifts - the norm for nursing shifts for many years. But, as in many other industries, a move towards two longer shifts per day is now more common. The theory is the shift pattern offers greater cost effectiveness for the NHS, in the form of fewer handovers, deemed unproductive. And for staff the change offers a better work-life balance, in the form of more days off, it has been argued. But Ms Smith likened long shifts to'slave labour', warning staff are falling sick due to exhaustion. 'The fact staff are so tired has a detrimental effect on patient care and not only compromises their own health but puts other staff at risk,' she said. 'There is a case for saying there is a better way [of organising shift work]' A motion calling for Unison to investigate the health impact of long shifts on nurses was passed at the conference. It comes as the Royal College of Nursing this week revealed, in their final report before next month's General Election, that despite a rise in the total number of nurses since 2010, 'the reality on the ground is that there are fewer nurses, providing more care'. Their Fragile Frontline report said the total number of posts in the last five years has risen by 6,434, but warned 'the true picture is less positive'.

Police have charged a man and woman over the discovery of a mass greyhound dog grave in Bundaberg. A 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were both charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Thursday. A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, also found ammunition shells from a.22 calibre gun. The pair, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. The carcasses of more than 50 greyhounds were found at the bush site in Coonarr on Tuesday. At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA.\u00a0Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow.

Obama has argued with the progressive potentate Elizabeth Warren, calling her \"wrong\" on trade policy.  The Massachusetts senator is the same potentate to whom Hillary Clinton has been religiously prostrating.  What everyone does next will be critical for the 2016 elections and the future of Democratic politics. Warren has publicly criticized so-called \"fast track\" trade authority that would allow the White House to negotiate massive, multination trade deals with little congressional oversight.  The authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is modeled on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and has killed 700,000 American jobs and drove wages down in the United States while simultaneously decimating Mexican agriculture and small businesses. Aspects of the TPP deal would provide incentives for off-shoring jobs to low-wage countries, imposing limits on government regulations around food safety and the environment, and create mechanisms for multinational corporations to challenge any domestic laws they simply don't like. In December, Warren wrote a letter signed by several other Democrats to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman raising concerns about the TPP.  The letter warned that the TPP could erode safeguards that have been put in place to \"prevent future financial crises.\" \"We cannot afford a trade deal that undermines the government's ability to protect the American economy,\" Warren wrote. At a town hall with MSNBC's Chris Matthews on Tuesday, President Obama said, \"I love Elizabeth. We're allies on a whole host of issues. But she's wrong on this.\" Obama added, \"When you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts, they are wrong.\" But \"I'm right and she's wrong\" doesn't exactly come off as a thoughtful, let alone respectful, response to the policy critiques of one of the most trusted economic justice leaders in the Democratic Party today. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is trying to walk a fine line somewhere in the middle.  Clinton has recently courted Warren's support while forcefully repeating the rhetoric of populism. But according to a report by The New York Times, Clinton's staff is at pains to suggest that Clinton has always been a populist as opposed to merely trying to now co-opt a current trend.

Kane's first outing as captain of Tottenham failed to inspire Spurs in an insipid 0-0 draw against Burnley in a result which helped neither side. Sean Dyche's Clarets would have escaped the bottom three had they won, while Spurs' hopes of a top-four spot look to have evaporated. Burnley defender Michael Duff was satisfied with\u00a0the way his side subdued prolific goalscorer Harry Kane. Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock at Turf Moor in the 0-0 draw on Sunday afternoon. 'I think as a team we handled him (Kane) well,' Duff told Sky Sports 1. 'We pressed them high up the pitch and you could see that many many times. It's something we pride ourselves on. 'We haven't got the multi-multi-million pound superstars that maybe some teams have in this league or the budget to go with it but we work hard and you can see the fans appreciate that.' Danny Ings missed an early chance to put Burnley ahead and Clarets defender Jason Shackell thinks his side need to be more clinical from now until the end of the season. 'I thought we played well today and we had a few chances,' the 31-year-old said. Burnley tried to press high up the pitch as a way of neutralising the threat posed by top scorer Kane. Duff clears the ball ahead of the challenge of Kane in a game that lacked clear-cut chances for both teams. 'We need to be a bit more clinical between now and the end of the season but it's another point and that's a point in the right direction. 'If he (Ings) had put the ball in the back of the net of course it would have been different but he's been phenomenal and will get a few more goals for us before the end of the season for sure.' Duff added: 'We just keep taking it a game at a time. It's another marker and another point in the right direction. It's a tough league and at times it's hard to get points so we'll take anything we can get.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson had a pop at Spurs substitute Andros Townsend after the match.

US giant Morgan Stanley said the prospect of a Labour government reliant on the Scottish Nationalists would create the \u2018greatest uncertainty\u2019 of any election result. Its inevitable \u2018anti-austerity\u2019 agenda could lead to an \u2018earlier bank rate hike than was previously the case\u2019, the bank argued. US giant Morgan Stanley said the prospect of a Labour government reliant on the Scottish Nationalists would create the \u2018greatest uncertainty\u2019 of any election result. Last night, a second major bank, Goldman Sachs, also raised concerns about the same outcome on May 7. Goldman said Labour would be \u2018dragged to the Left\u2019 by the SNP, which would result in even more money going north of the border \u2018at the expense of the UK as a whole\u2019. It warned that Labour would be then expected to abandon its pledge to manage the public finances carefully. The reports are a double blow to Labour\u2019s attempts to convince voters that the economy would be in safe hands with a Mr Miliband-led government. In an election research note, Morgan Stanley said that a Labour-led government reliant on the \u2018anti-austerity and separatist SNP\u2019 would lead investors to predict a \u2018substantially looser fiscal policy\u2019.

Nicola Sturgeon's (left) Scottish National Party would drag Ed Miliband (right) and the Labour party into its anti-austerity agenda,\u00a0Goldman Sachs warned last night.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Cairo (CNN)Mohamed Morsy went from prison to the presidency. And now he's going back to prison. The ousted President was convicted on charges of violence and inciting violence and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the torture of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012. But he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters. He stood trial with 14 co-defendants, including some of his presidential staff. All 14 co-defendants were also convicted of violence and inciting violence, and all were also acquitted of murder. Morsy, who became Egypt's first democratically elected President in June 2012, was deposed by a popularly backed military coup in July 2013. After the sentencing, his Freedom and Justice Party called the trial a \"travesty of justice.\" \"This is a sad and terrible day in Egyptian history,\" the party said in a statement Tuesday. \"Coup leaders have sentenced Mohamed Morsi to decades in prison for nothing more than championing the democratic will of the people.\" But Ramy Ghanem, a civil plaintiff lawyer representing one of the torture victims, said the conviction was fair. \"This is a very appropriate and clear verdict on people that committed the crime,\" he said. \"This, in fact, was the maximum sentence for the charges. The surprise was the acquittal.\" Hoda Nasrallah, a lawyer representing two torture victims, called the outcome of the case typical for Egypt. \"All the cases involving big gatherings and demonstrations in which protesters were killed usually see the culprits walk free. This case is a manifestation of this,\" she said. \"The public will always see the verdicts as politicized because there is no regime put on trial before falling, so everyone sees it as settling scores. It's not about Morsy only, but it also applies to (former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak and others. This is the status quo in Egypt. We wish we could see the trial of a regime when it is in power, not after that.\" Nasrallah called for a \"fair trial,\" criticizing the fact that seven men killed during the December 2012 clashes were not included in this case, because they were affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, and that the involvement of other sides, including police, wasn't investigated. Morsy can appeal his conviction. But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Mohamed Montasser has already issued an ominous warning on Twitter:. \"Sentencing the president won't pass,\" he said. \"The revolution will be ignited, popular anger will increase and we\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Business leaders have voiced their fears over the 'disastrous Tory campaign' which they believe has been too focussed on 'personal attacks and scaremongering'. They expressed concerns over the negative tactics employed by the Conservative campaign ahead of the general election next month \u2013 which they believe have done little to discredit Ed Miliband. As it emerged that the Labour leader is now the bookies' favourite to be the next prime minister, a number of business leaders revealed they are worried David Cameron will lose the battle for Number 10. And it appears Mr Cameron's advisers have the same fear and have called on campaigners to change tack today. Scroll down for video. Business leaders have blasted the 'disastrous Tory campaign' which has focussed too much on personal attacks against the opposition. Pictured: David Cameron in Lincoln today (left) and Ed Miliband campaigning at Chatham House, London, today. Business leaders said Cameron's role in delivering economic growth had become the 'background noise' of the Conservative campaign when it should have been the focus. The critique comes just weeks after more than 100 of Britain's top business leaders backed the Conservatives' economic plan in what was described as an 'unprecedented move' urging voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a notable intervention weeks from the election on May 7, the business chiefs, who run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee, signed a better claiming a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. But now, a number of FTSE 100 and other business leaders have anonymously criticised Mr Cameron's use of personal attacks on his opposition. Speaking to the\u00a0Financial Times on the condition that they would not be named, one chairman said: 'The negative campaign has been disastrous'. Another added that the successes of the coalition government, including delivering real economic growth and jobs has become the 'background noise' of the campaign instead of its focus. But a Conservative spokesman insisted that the campaign's focus on the idea of the SNP in a coalition with Labour is doing well on the doorstep, according to the FT. Some argued the campaign's focus has been too narrow and that 'fear tactics' could backfire badly. 'The Scottish scaremongering plays into the SNP's hands,' said one chief. And it appears Tory tacticians had believed Mr Cameron's economic record would have delivered a solid poll lead by now. The polls put Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband on equal footing \u2013 and several business leaders suggest this is a result of the Conservatives underestimating the\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Sentenced: As well as the probation, he was fined $100,000 for leaking classified information to his mistress. Following the hearing, he briefly addressed the media outside the courthouse. 'As I did in the past, I apologize for those closest to me and many others,' he said, before thanking his supporters including his family, colleagues and fellow veterans.

We are, however, surprised that Mr. Bates would choose to go on a vacation to the Bahamas during this tumultuous time.

Bates claims he meant to stun Harris with a Taser after Harris fled from officers, but mistakenly shot Harris with a gun instead. Bates has said the shooting was accidental. He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz.

Guests attending a service in London to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo have been told not to act in a 'triumphalist' way \u2013 to avoid upsetting the French. Invitations to the service at St Paul's Cathedral advise that it will avoid glorifying the Duke of Wellington's historic victory over Napoleon in 1815.

Instead, the service \u2013 to be attended by members of the Royal Family and senior political and military figures \u2013 will focus on the 'pan-European' implications of the battle and the century of peace that followed.

Napoleon was responsible for between three million and 6.5 million deaths. 'Two hundred years on, it is ridiculous to spare the blushes of the French by not celebrating the battle for what it was.

The service of commemoration, to take place on the 200th anniversary of Waterloo on June 18, will be the centrepiece of a series of events to mark the battle. Waterloo 200 chairman, Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, defended the 'no triumphalism' theme. Asked if it looked as though the service was designed to avoid embarrassing the French, he said: 'Some people may read it like that but it's not how we look at it.' He added that the enemy at Waterloo was Napoleon \u2013 not France as such. The commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle on Europe, not the military campaign or the battle itself. 'What Waterloo brought in was an extended period of peace in Europe after a particularly horrible 20 years of war,' Sir Evelyn said. 'The commemoration looks forward to the European harmony that followed it.' Colin Brown, author of Scum Of The Earth, a new book about Waterloo, said Wellington would not have objected to the non-triumphalist tone.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)Remember the Tuskegee syphilis experiment from the 1930s? Scientists studied poor African-Americans in Alabama who'd contracted the venereal disease but didn't tell them they had the disease or do anything to cure them. A lawsuit filed this week alleges Johns Hopkins University and the Rockefeller Foundation helped conduct a similar study in Guatemala from 1945 to 1956. Orphans, inmates, psychiatric patients and prostitutes were deliberately infected with sexually transmitted diseases to determine what drugs, including penicillin, worked best in stopping the diseases, the lawsuit says. The subjects of the experiments weren't told they'd been infected, the lawsuit says, causing some to die and others to pass the disease to their spouses, sexual partners and children. The suit seeks more than $1 billion in damages and has 774 plaintiffs, including people who were subjects in the experiments and their descendants. This is the second attempt to collect damages. In 2012, a class-action federal lawsuit was filed against the U.S. government over the Guatemala experiments conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service. A judge dismissed it, saying the Guatemalans could not sue the United States for grievances that happened overseas. The new lawsuit was filed in the Baltimore City Circuit Court. Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation filed statements on their websites condemning the experiments, but denying responsibility. \"The plaintiffs' essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members' participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore Johns Hopkins should be held liable,\" the Johns Hopkins statement said. \"Neither assertion is true.\" The lawsuit alleges the Rockefeller Foundation funded Johns Hopkins' research into public health issues, including venereal disease, and employed scientists who monitored the Guatemala experiments. The lawsuit, the Rockefeller Foundation statement said, \"seeks improperly to assign 'guilt by association' in the absence of compensation from the United States federal government.\" The suit says Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation designed, supported and benefited from the Guatemala experiments. Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical group and that company's owner, Mead Johnson, also are defendants. The pharmaceutical company supplied drugs for the experiments, the suit says. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb sent this statement to CNN: \"We've only just received the complaint in this matter.

An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane.

In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.'

But Cuba's attempts to rebrand itself as an open, diverse society stumbled Wednesday when government supporters and anti-Castro supporters brawled in the streets of Panama. Video of the incident showed Cuban government officials exchanging punches and insults with dissidents until Panamanian police in riot gear broke up the melee.

The R-Type was the\u00a0second series of post-war Bentley automobiles, replacing the Mark VI. It was considered the epitome of British luxury in the 1950s as well as being the first car to carry the Continental nameplate. It was the fastest production car of the period as it could reach 120mph. But despite its speed capability, the Continental model was produced specifically for the domestic market in continental Europe. And despite vehicles having the same uniform style, each car was unique in detail and unlike almost every car of its time, the Continental had an all-aluminum body.

Christine Lagarde, the first female chief executive of the International Monetary Fund, left, in a pink Chanel suit and\u00a0Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, right, chose hot pink for her live election debate last Thursday. The sudden rise in use among powerful women is said to be down to the way that the colour is perceived - it used to be a girly but is now considered an appropriate shade to wear to a business meeting. In an interview with the newspaper the managing director of image consultants Colour Me Beautiful, Veronique Henderson, said: 'Pink was for a long time viewed as a girlie colour. It was seen as romantic, not serious in business, but that has changed.' Style icon Samantha Cameron is also a big fan of the colour - she chose a pale dusty pink silk top on the campaign trail for the local and European elections last May. Meanwhile, on daytime television both Lorraine Kelly and Ruth Langsford can regularly be seen in pink dresses while presenting their ITV TV shows.

President Vladimir Putin cuts an isolated figure, closely guarded behind the walls of the Kremlin, traveling to-and-fro by helicopter or high-speed motorcade. His almost daily appearances on state television often show him in formal meetings with subordinates, or visiting dignitaries. Interaction with ordinary Russians is usually carefully controlled and fleeting. That is why this annual Q&A session -- in which Putin will spend hours fielding questions from the general public on live television -- is such a widely anticipated event which provokes such excitement. It is direct access to the Russian leader, or at least as direct as most Russians will ever get. In recent years, sitting in a shiny studio surrounded by a hand-picked audience of soldiers, doctors, teachers, factory workers and so on, Putin has held forth on subjects from parenting to food prices, to relations with America. Last year he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes. In 2013, it was a record-breaking 4 hours and 47 minutes. Organizers say this year, public interest is especially strong. At one call center in Moscow, where the public are encouraged to pitch their Putin questions, officials say more than 200,000 questions were submitted in the first hour after lines opened. The Kremlin says they will have to sift through well over 1.7 million emails, video messages and texts to decide who gets to ask what on the big day. A few would-be questions released ahead of the event give us a flavor of what's on Russia's mind. One man, who identifies himself as Vitaly from the Leningrad region, asks: \"Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin's middle name), why are prices going up in the shops but wages are staying the same?\" Sanctions and Russia's deep economic crisis, which saw the value of the Russian currency, the ruble, plunge in value by 50% against the dollar, is set to be a major a theme. So too is foreign policy. With Moscow at odds with the West over Ukraine, some of the released questions show how concerned ordinary Russians are about their country's place in the world. One unidentified schoolgirl asks: \"Is there a threat to Russia's interests from the United States and Europe? And will there be a new Iron Curtain?\" It's not just Russian schoolchildren who want to hear Putin's answer. Critics of the Kremlin, of\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton\" earlier this year. In addition to that ruling, Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight's bail to $10 million from $25 million, a figure that defense lawyers called excessive. The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight. In all, Knight will stand trial on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run, the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots, and the case has clearly strained him: He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Knight was in court Thursday. At the end of hearing, he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery, and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom. In a press conference after the hearing, fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight's health that he is \"doing much better.\" The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon, in this case the vehicle Knight was driving, is used against several people. Knight is accused of running over two men, killing one of them, during an argument. Killed was Terry Carter, 55. The survivor is Cle Sloan, 51, who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn't want to be a \"snitch\" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton,\" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: How Neanderthals met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians. One theory is that early modern humans 'bullied' their Neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive. But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by Neanderthals. The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the Early Ahmarian culture and the Protoaurignacian culture, living in south and west Europe and west Asia around 40,000 years ago. They found the human tools (pictured) were no more effective than Neanderthal-created tools of the same era. Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived Neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought. Traditionally, scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of Africa to Europe. But the new study by Nagoya University and the University of Tokyo in Japan argues Neanderthals were just as well-equipped as their human counterparts. 'We're not so special, I don't think we survived Neanderthals simply because of technological competence,' said Dr Seiji Kadowaki, first author of the study from Nagoya University, Japan. On the left is a map of the Levant showing the locations of the Early Ahmarian-related sites analysed in this study. Neanderthals (reconstruction right) may not have been as dim-witted as first believe, claims the study.

Murphy, player of the month for February and March, went over in the left corner on 15 minutes from Jake Connor's pass. He was then on hand when Ukuma Ta'ai, who also scored twice, caught and off-loaded a kick from Danny Brough on 37 minutes. In-form winger Aaron Murphy scored twice in a seven-try romp as Huddersfield beat Catalans Dragons. Former Wakefield Wildcats star Murphy, 27, has now scored six tries in his last five appearances. Having fallen behind Catalans hit back to lead 8-6 - with scrum-half Scott Dureau bagging all of their points. He scored a try on 21 minutes when Elliot Whitehead passed inside after a solo dash past two players split the Giants defence. Dureau converted and then added a penalty goal on 24 minutes for a poor shoulder charge on him by Joe Wardle. Wardle was restored to the Giants line-up after being suspended for last week's defeat by St Helens for a dangerous throw on Ben Cockayne. Huddersfield responded with three tries in 10 minutes at the end of the first half - and it could have been more. Connor nearly put Murphy in again down the left on 27 minutes while Leroy Cudjoe was held up on the right flank after Brough's break from deep. In between Ta'ai pounced for a try when a Dragons defender fumbled a high kick from Brough on 30 minutes. Scotland star Brough, whose kicking caused problems for the visitors all game, was at it twice more before half-time. His kick led to Murphy's second try and then another Brough bomb was dropped on the hooter by a defender and Cudjoe pounced. Brough, who took his tally to 58 points for the season with three earlier conversions, this time hit the post. Huddersfield led 22-8 at the break, with the sides trading tries after the restart as Catalans narrowed the gap to 26-14. Julian Bousquet scored a converted try on 45 minutes while Jermaine McGillvary went over at the other end eight minutes later. There was controversy on 62 minutes when a simmering feud between Cudjoe and Willie Tong boiled over.

Rockhold capped a brief and brilliant appearance in the cage with a rear naked choke at 2:32 of the second round and made Lyoto Machida tap to win a main event showdown between two of the top middleweights in UFC on Saturday night. Luke Rockhold beat Lyoto Machida by second-round submission in New Jersey. Rockhold celebrates his victory and now wants a shot at the middleweight title. 'I am the No 1 contender,' Rockhold said. 'I'm the best guy around.' Rockhold should be next in line for a pay-per-view title shot in the 185-pound division. With a dominant win over the 36-year-old Machida, he positioned himself to take on the winner of the UFC 187 fight next month between Chris Weidman and Vitor Belfort. Machida never put up much of a fight in his brief stint in the cage. Rockhold lost on his UFC debut in 2013, then rebounded with wins over Costas Philippou, Tim Boetsch, Michael Bisping. He won his third straight fight via submission and looked at his best at the Prudential Center. 'I did my part,' Rockhold said. 'Weidman, you're going to do your part. Let's take this across the way. Madison Square Garden, let's make history.' Rockhold was dominant from the first bell as he cruised to victory against Machida. Machida was marked up badly after the first round and didn't last long in the second session. MMA would have to become legalized in New York for that bout to happen. The Senate again approved a bill to legalize and regulate the combat sport that includes boxing, judo, wrestling and kickboxing. UFC remained hopeful that the assembly will finally approve the bill that would allow the promotion to stage a dream card in December at MSG. 'If it doesn't happen, it'll be crazy,' UFC President Dana White said. Jacare Souza, the No 1 ranked middleweight, made short work of Chris Camozzi in the co-main event.

Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becoming prime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meant to convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has sought to be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq. The Obama administration, which welcomed Abadi's ascension after a tricky relationship with former Prime Minister Nurial-Maliki, may not agree to provide significant additional support. Obama, who was elected on the back of a promise to end the war in Iraq, is limited by public aversion to U.S. entanglement in another regional conflict and congressional constraints on his budget authority. In August, Obama authorized the first U.S. air strikes on Iraq since the 2011 withdrawal of American troops. He has also deployed about 3,000 American military forces to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. Abadi said after the meeting that Iraq would respect other countries' sovereignty and expected the same. He also said he was eager to bring all of the fighters in Iraq under state control.

Now one historian claims he has unraveled what may have lead to the downfall of Ancient Egypt and other Bronze Age civilisations collapse. He claims they were hit by a 'perfect storm' of disasters 3,200 years ago that left the Ancient Egyptians, the Babylonians, Minoans and Mycenians unable to cope. The Sphinx and pyramids at Giza (above) hint at the power of ancient Egyptian civilisation before it collapsed. As each of these great societies were interconnected, the collapse of one also affected the others, creating a domino-like effect, claims Professor Eric Cline, director of the Capitol Archaeological Institute at George Washington University. He claims that a series of droughts, famines, climate change, earthquakes, invasions and internal rebellions between 1225BC and 1177 BC happened in quick succession. Egypt's Old Kingdom - when most of the pyramids were built - collapsed more than 4,200 years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change, according to research. Scientists examined 7,000-year-old ancient pollen and charcoal samples from the Nile to piece together the time - and found evidence of a'mega drought' in the the area. The droughts brought fires, famine and social unrest to the region. Pollen grains obtained from the bottom of the Sea of Galilee have also provided similar evidence that the region endured a 150 year drought between 1250BC and 1100BC. Scientists behind the study say there was a\u00a0sharp decline around 1250 BCE in oaks, pines, and carob trees\u2014the traditional flora of the Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age. Plants usually found in semiarid desert regions increase while the number of olive trees - an important crop plant - also declined. Speaking to Haaretz, he said: 'Normally if a culture if faced with just one of these tragedies, it can survive it, but what if they all happened at once or in quick succession. 'I think that the Late Bronze Age civilisations were simply unable to weather the \"perfect storm\" and cam crashing down. 'The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium BCE, which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, long-used trade routes were abandoned, along with writing systems, advanced technology, and monumental architecture.'

Leading King historian Stuart Wexler said that the bureau chose to cover up the potential role of a high level informant in the killing rather than tell the truth. Wexler said that it could have been one of the greatest scandals in the history of the FBI - but now we may never know what happened. By destroying the files the FBI disobeyed a direct order not to do so from a Congressional Committee which had been set up to investigate the killing of King and former President John F Kennedy. Wexler told Daily Mail Online that the bureau's actions were 'disturbing' and that his research had left him suspecting that agents had mounted a deliberate operation to bury the truth forever. King was shot dead by James Earl Ray on 4 April 1968 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee in a killing which galvanized the civil rights movement. Power: Dr King's leadership of the civil rights movement was demonstrated in the I Have A Dream speech in 1963. His death on 4 April 1968 shocked a nation already scarred by the deaths of President John F Kennedy - and the civil leader's murder was followed by that of Robert Kennedy. Guard: The balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, where Dr King was shot. Caught: James Earl Ray, the assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr. being taken to his cell by Sheriff William Morris,  in Memphis Tennessee, July 19, 1968. He had been on the run since the death. Key figures: James Earl Ray (left) in the wanted picture issued by the FBI.

But Wexler said that there are still many unanswered questions about his death which he addresses in a new e-book called 'Killing King'. The FBI plot began when the House Committee on Assassinations was set up in 1976 - it would finish its inquiries into the killing of King and Kennedy in 1978.

Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the \u00a3400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard.

He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited \u00a3500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier.

FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring. The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend. It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring. Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat. In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud.

John Shaw, a senior at Texas A&M Galveston and student in Horwitz's class, told KPRC he was worried about the job he has lined up after graduation. \"Just ridiculous, because, I mean, I had never had a problem in the class,\" Shaw said. \"I thought I had done pretty well, done pretty well on the first test and everything else that's going on.

University officials said the department head will take over teaching the strategic management class. \"None of them have failed until the end of the class, meaning the only reason a student would fail is because he or she hasn't performed the actual, you know, with the expectations for that particular class,\" Louchouarn said.

A thug has been jailed for mugging a frail pensioner who was knocked to the ground for \u00a35 after he asked the courts to lock him up for a 'long time'. Solomon Bygraves, 29, was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting robbing 93-year-old Stanley Evans in the entrance to his block of flats in central London as he returned from a shopping trip.

Today, the court heard how Bygraves, who at more than six foot, towered over his victim, targeted the elderly man because he was frail and old.

Mr al-Saadi has fought a legal battle against the British Government claiming it was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to his homeland to be tortured by the Gaddafi regime. But the IPT said the dissident should not receive compensation for breaching Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to private and family life. Intelligence chiefs sparked fury in February by admitting that they had unlawfully listened in to lawyer-client communications even though they are generally covered by 'legal professional privilege' to protect privacy and the right to a free trial.

A married GP who fondled a vulnerable teenager's breasts when she came to him complaining of chest pains has been jailed for 18 months. Dr Unt Tun Maung, 43, was working as a locum GP when he assaulted the patient during a routine examination at a Teesside medical centre in 2012, Durham Crown Court was previously told. The father-of-one, of Chester-le-Street, County Durham, had spent 12 years working in the NHS, but has now lost everything because of a'moment of madness', his lawyer told the court. The attack took place during a routine appointment in July 2012 when the girl went to Maung complaining of chest pains. Maung then asked the teenager to remove her bra, before cupping and squeezing her breasts before telling her to put her clothes back on. After the incident, the woman texted a friend to say she felt she had been sexually abused. In a statement read to the court, she said had not wanted to believe she had been taken advantage of, but she could not rid it from her mind. Then, when she visited another doctor a few months later with another chest infection, she panicked while being examined, the court heard. A complaint was made to the NHS, although the police were not alerted for'several months', prosecutor Peter Makepeace said. Dr Maung came from a medical family and had worked in the NHS since moving to the UK in 2000, Mr Hurst said, and was held in high regard both professionally and personally. He had devoted 12 years of his life to working in the NHS and had also helped contribute to his Buddhist community, defence barrister Andrew Hurst said.

Although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months, there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement. For Democrats, there is ample reason to be excited about Clinton's run for the presidency. She is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades. She brings to the table extensive political and policy experience, a combination of skills that is often lacking. She has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before. She has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media, how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies. She is a hardened, tough partisan who will not shy away from Republican attack. Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency. If Hillary Clinton puts together an effective campaign, she could be unbeatable in the Democratic primaries as well as in the general election. However, during the buildup to her final decision, some of her weaknesses have also been exposed. Clinton doesn't want to end up like Vice President Al Gore in 2000. Although he did relatively well in the final election (with many Americans believing that he did actually defeat George W. Bush) he didn't generate much energy once the campaign started. Although he too was touted as a \"perfect\" candidate who was the ideal person for the job, something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail. He seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling. Gore had trouble connecting with voters, and he seemed to remake his image constantly. His biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee, rather than what he actually stood for. Clinton must avoid following Gore's path. She suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and can't afford to do so again. She needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience. That is not enough. More important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the White House. Voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents, even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized Washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change. A recent story in The Washington Post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability.

The deadliest migrant tragedy on the Mediterranean so far took this year's death toll on the waters to a staggering 1,800. It came as three other people - including a tiny child - died when a rickety wooden boat ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes.

The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece. But an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels today will announce that only 5,000 refugees who survive the perilous journey will be granted safe haven in Europe and the rest will be sent back, the Guardian has reported.

Alice is the name of the Queen's aunt, who passed away in 2004 aged 102, while Charlotte is favoured as a nod to William's father Charles. According to the newspaper, if the child is a boy then 13 per cent of people would like him to be called James, with the second favourite name being Alexander. Many people are hoping for a girl though - of the 2,200 people polled, a quarter said they wanted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to have a female baby, with only three percent hoping for a younger brother for George.

'I'm desperate to get rid of it, I have bad dreams about it,' she said on Channel 5 show Tattoo Disasters. Scroll down for video. Jessica Hardy was so desperate to remove her former flame's name from her forearm she used acid. The mother-of-one said she couldn't afford laser removal surgery to have the tattoo removed so when she heard about acid peels for the skin, she thought she had an ideal solution. 'I came across a YouTube video about acid peels so I thought that would be the way to get rid of my tattoo. The kit cost \u00a325 online and I thought \"bargain\".' But instead of removing her tattoo as she hoped, Jessica's dangerous DIY treatment gave her chemical burns. A chemical peel should be applied by a beauty professional as it's designed to damage the skin in a controlled way. The body responds to the damage by healing and rejuvenating the skin - supposedly making it look younger. But Jessica applied the acid without diluting it with water or reading the instructions. As a result, it immediately caused her skin to burn and blister. Jessica's tattoo, left, featuring the name of her ex, and the burns she suffered, right, after applying acid. Six painful applications left Jessica's skin red raw and scabby - and the tattoo remained. She said: 'It felt like someone had poured boiling water on my arm and then got a lighter to it. 'After five minutes it went white and blistered, then started peeling, after three days it went all scabby. 'I didn't want to get it checked in case the nurses thought I was self-harming and I didn't want them to take the acid off me as I still wanted it.' Despite her painful first encounter with the acid, Jessica repeated the treatment another six times. Her skin became red raw, scabby and inflamed - and worst of all, the tattoo was still visible. Realising her DIY treatments were a painful failure, Jessica finally sought the advice of tattoo artist Aaron Mullen.

And I do. Recently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what?

I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well.\" Jackie Demate, also 21, agreed. \"I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe.\" At first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, \"Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!\" Jackie didn't blink. \"But, Europe!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy.... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy.\" Before you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once. That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960. What a fine example my generation is! Not. Still, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Canberra, Australia (CNN)Before \"Bali Nine\" duo,  Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the last Australian executed for drug offenses abroad was Van Tuong Nguyen by Singapore in 2005. Although Canberra then, as it is now, was strongly opposed to the death penalty, Van's death did not harm Australia's relationship with Singapore, nor the Australian people's view of that country. The executions of Chan and Sukumaran early Wednesday morning will be a different story. Their deaths will result in short to medium term frictions between Canberra and Jakarta at the highest levels. However, this will soon ease as the two countries have a number of common interests that neither side can abandon. But the Australian public's view of Indonesia, and anger with its government, will take much longer to subside. Those sympathetic to the dilemma faced by Indonesia's President Joko Widodo will argue that he was politically bound to allow the executions to take place. He ran on a robust anti-drug campaign, arguing that 18,000 Indonesians die from illicit drugs each year, though those figures are widely disputed. As the saga over whether the executions would take place dragged on for months, following ever more desperate legal challenges from the defense teams, Widodo painted himself into a corner. The widespread Australian perception is that the President owed his power to PDI-P Chairperson and former President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Believed by many to be the most powerful person in the country, some suggest that Megawati insisted Widodo stand by his hard-line anti-drugs policy and stare down Australian pressure -- or lose her support and reputation as a firm leader in the process. As recently as last year, it seemed that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott empathized with the underlying pressures and back-room obligations on leaders. While working assiduously behind the scenes to argue for clemency for the \"Bali Nine\" duo, Abbott nevertheless appeared to accept the inevitability of the executions, even as he publicly reiterated Australia's opposition to capital punishment. Such a softly\u2014softly approach was also aided by an Australian public that did not seem overly interested in the plight of Chan and Sukumaran. All that changed when credible stories began to emerge about the rehabilitation of the two Australian prisoners: Chan becoming a pastor and respected religious example for his fellow prisoners and Sukumaran a passionate painter with impressive talent.

But Brown insists King's team will never turn their back on a man who struck 355 goals in Light Blue - even if his tenure as manager ended in disappointment as Hearts romped towards the Scottish Championship title.

The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born by surrogate mother. Injaz is pictured here when she was just six days old. Dr Nisar Wani, scientific director of the Reproductive Biotechnology Centre in Nad Al Sheba, Dubai, told The National: \u2018We are very excited because Injaz is now pregnant and we expect to have a calf from her late this year. \u2018She has conceived in a natural way.

After a 30-minute taxi ride through darkness and impenetrable forests, The Datai appeared with all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City. Full-size carved horses illuminated by antique torches guarded the entrance, as beautiful silk sari-clad Malaysian staff welcomed us with cocktails.

Begiristain\u2019s meeting and rejection of Klopp back in 2013 adds weight to the growing evidence that Klopp will not get the Manchester City job even though the Borussia Dortmund manager quit this week, fuelling a wave of speculation about which Premier League clubs might want to appoint him this summer. Manchester City have already met Jurgen Klopp to assess him for the manager\u2019s job \u2013 but it was back in 2013. The Dortmund boss will leave the club at the end of this season, with suggestions he could take over at City. Pellegrini\u2019s position is clearly vulnerable given City\u2019s failures this year on all fronts \u2013 in the Champions League, which was the principal target, the Premier League and the domestic cups. However, there is an insistence at the club that it should be not be automatically assumed that Pellegrini will be dismissed as, unlike when Mancini went, the club is running smoothly off the pitch without the internal tensions and disagreements which characterised Mancini\u2019s last days. There will be the usual end-of-season review of the manager\u2019s performance but this would take place every season, whatever success or not had been achieved. Pellegrini will clearly have to answer difficult questions about the team\u2019s under performance, especially as they have sunk to fourth place and run the risk of being overhauled by Liverpool for the Champions League. However, Begiristain would also expect to answer questions about the recruitment of players last summer such as Eliaquim Mangala for \u00a335million and Fernando for \u00a313m, neither of whom has made an impact. On the plus side for Pellegrini, his style of play is seen as compatible with the type of club Begiristain and his colleague, chief executive Ferran Soriano, are attempting to create. City opted for Manuel Pellegrini after holding talks with both the Chilean and Klopp two years ago. Roberto Mancini left the Etihad Stadium in 2013 after failing to defend his Premier League crown.

He wrote of his admiration for Waze, according to screenshots taken by Breitbart, which he was using to track two officers in Staten Island, New York. The post was said to be made in early December. He used the same account to announce his intentions to gun down the two officers in Brooklyn, styling it as a revenge attack for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown.

When Cook slapped a Kemar Roach full toss to the boundary in the early stages of his reply to West Indies\u2019 299 on Wednesday, he moved beyond Alec Stewart into second place among England\u2019s great Test accumulators. Now only Graham Gooch, the man Cook returned to earlier this year to try to restore his batting to full working order, stands above an England captain who is very much fighting for his leadership future in this series. Alastair Cook passed Alec Stewart's 8,463 runs to become England's second highest Test run-scorer. Cook had watched West Indies\u2019 last pair of Devendra Bishoo and Shannon Gabriel add an unlikely 52 to undo much of the good work provided by a welcome burst of wickets from Stuart Broad. It lifted the hosts to a score that should have been beyond them and left Cook and Jonathan Trott, both under pressure after their failures in Antigua, with the final session of the second day to begin the climb towards a total big enough to press for a priceless victory. Trott had been frenetic on his return to the side in Antigua but here he was much more like his old self, scratching away at the crease and meticulous both off his pads and on the drive. Anything short, particularly from the pacey Gabriel, was swiftly ducked. Cook, meanwhile, looked comfortable with his new stance even though he could easily have fallen on 29 off the leg-spinner Bishoo. When bad light stopped play they had reached 74 and England, perhaps, were back on top. One man who definitely looked back to his best form was Broad, who bowled beyond 90mph for the first time since returning from surgery while claiming three wickets for 19 when rain finally relented. Earlier the crowd for only the third Test to be staged on the spice island, which included thousands of England supporters, had to display extreme patience as cricket again embarrassed itself in the face of weather problems.

The report, by Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry, said 766 violent anti-Semitic acts were carried out around the world last year - marking a huge increase from the previous year. Arson, vandalism and direct threats against Jews, synagogues and other Jewish institutions were included in the figure, making 2014 the worst year for such attacks since 2009. The study said: 'The overall feeling among many Jewish people is one of living in an intensifying anti-Jewish environment that has become not only insulting and threatening, but outright dangerous. In particular, it cited 'alarming reports especially from Western Europe and North America'. Anger in Western Europe over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip last July and August, as well as anti-Jewish caricatures in the media and social networks had helped to turn anti-Semitism into an 'almost daily phenomena seen and felt in every sphere of life', the report said. In France, the number of anti-Semitic attacks rose to 164 in 2014 compared with 141 in 2013. In January this year, four hostages were killed in a Paris kosher supermarket in violence that began when Islamist militants carried out a massacre in the office of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly. Britain registered 141 violent incidents against Jews in 2014, after 95 a year earlier. In one of the most serious attacks a victim was called a 'Jewish c***' and then hit with a glass and a baseball bat in London.

British officers were forced to accept the four-day inspection from the experts from Moscow under a European arms control treaty despite heightened tensions with Vladimir Putin. They are attending Exercise Joint Warrior, designed to send a signal to the President in the face of continuing aggression. Britain and 11 other Nato countries are set to contribute to the naval exercise, which was hailed by the Government as one of the largest land, air, and sea training exercises run in Europe. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the exercise, involving 58 warships and submarines, 50 aircraft and 3,000 land forces would show the world how \u2018powerful\u2019 Nato was.

Britain has not inspected Russian since 2010, however Russia is still obliged to accept inspections twice a year from other countries.

The memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble, disciplined and united, something voters in Iowa and others states have said Clinton did not do in 2008. \"This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us,\" reads the document that was obtained by CNN. In the section about the campaign's guiding principles, the document reads, \"We are humble: We take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always outcompete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states.\" It also calls on campaign staffers to remain \"disciplined\" and \"open to a diverse range of views.\" \"When we disagree, it's never personal. Once a decision is made, we execute it -- together,\" reads the memo. \"We know there will be tough days, but we will bounce back and get back to work.\" The document also appears to telegraph the name to Clinton's campaign: \"Hillary for America.\" Clinton is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, according to Democratic sources. Shortly after her announcement, Clinton will travel Iowa and New Hampshire, critical early caucus primary and caucus states.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Eastern Sydney's Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for Luke Lazarus 'out of loyalty to the family' after he raped an 18-year-old woman in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub, in Sydney. Now the controversial councillor is developing 'a new risky behaviour education program to try and help young women understand and better deal with being in vulnerable situations'. In an interview with the Wentworth Courier she referenced the behaviour of Lazarus's victim. The Mayor of three years said: 'By the sheer fact of (the assault) happening at a nightclub and alcohol is involved, (means people are) open to the possibility of risky behaviour, so I'm saying let's try and close that loophole.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Cr Betts for comment. Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for convicted rapist Luke Lazarus and is now developing 'a new risky behaviour education program' for young women. Cr Betts is reportedly developing the program for school girls alongside Waverley Action for Youth Services (WAYS) and the police. Lazarus, a 23-year-old former private school boy, was jailed for at least three years on March 27 after he raped the teenage virgin in an alleyway. During Lazarus's trial, the jury was told that he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into the alleyway. The court heard that during the assault he pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)The terrorist group Al-Shabaab has claimed an attack on Garissa University College in eastern Kenya, in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage. The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group's activities, and a clear indicator that the security situation in East Africa is deteriorating fast. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in Kenya, the most well-known of them being the massacre at the Westgate Shopping Centre in Nairobi in 2013. Cross-border raids into Kenya by the group, however, date back to 2011. Al-Shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in Nairobi, which sent troops to Somalia as part of an African Union mission in support of Somalia's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from Al-Shabaab and other militants for several years. Al-Shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the Koran as al-Qaeda and ISIS (also known as Islamic State), but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support. Its origins lie in Al-Ittihad al-Islami (Unity of Islam), one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of Siad Barre in 1991. These disparate groups fought each other and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country, from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later. Al-Shabaab (literally \"the Youth\") split from Unity of Islam in 2003 and merged with another radical Islamist group, the so-called Islamic Courts Union. As their alliance obtained control of Somalia's capital Mogadishu in 2006, Ethiopia, the only majority Christian country in the region, took military action against the group. The offensive weakened Al-Shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern Somalia, but it failed to defeat it. To the contrary, Ethiopia's invasion and occupation of parts of Somalia -- although invited by the Somali government and backed by the African Union -- enabled Al-Shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an Islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign \"Christian\" invasion. Initially, the group primarily attacked Ethiopian forces, but soon began to \"expand\" its activities against the Somali government as well. The first attack outside Somalia was an attack in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in 2010. Soon after this, cross-\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Pietersen has returned to the LV= County Championship in a bid to stake a claim for an England recall, although the 34-year-old only managed 19 runs against Glamorgan on Sunday. England were held to a draw in the opening Test of a three-match series against West Indies last week, and calls for a Pietersen comeback continue to linger ahead of the Ashes this summer. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 in his first outing for Surrey this season but scored just 19 against\u00a0Glamorgan.

The desperate search for survivors from the country's worst natural disaster in more than 80 years continued. The number of people confirmed dead in Nepal stands at 3,218, said Nepalese Ministry of Home Affairs spokesman Laxmi Dhakal. India has reported 56 deaths, and China another 20. The death toll is expected to climb further as officials get information from the rugged countryside that makes up most of Nepal. As day broke Monday, Nepal was still in survival mode after suffering a series of aftershocks following the huge initial quake on Saturday. The damage was everywhere. Stunned residents wandered the streets of Kathmandu, the capital city of roughly 3 million people that's now the focus of international disaster relief efforts. People dug through piles of debris where their homes once stood, seeking pieces of their former lives and, possibly, family members. Many of the injured were treated outside overflowing hospitals, where crowds of people gathered looking for relatives. Dhakal, the government spokesman, said Monday 6,525 people were reported to have been injured. One video aired on Nepal State Television captured a rare bright moment amid the death and devastation. It shows uniformed officers digging though rubble, desperately trying to free a man who is hurt but alive. Rescuers lift him up, and cheers of joy erupt from the crowd. The clip shows him being put on a stretcher and carried to safety. But often, searchers have found bodies rather than survivors.

Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having \u00a334million in the bank. Fans are upset and alarmed at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition which has left them with a threadbare squad in danger of relegation. A statement from AshleyOut.com read: \u2018For those fans wishing to attend the Swansea game, we request them to #StandUpToAshley after 34 minutes of the game, to represent the fact that having no manager and a threadbare squad devoid of quality, yet having \u00a334m in the bank is not an acceptable situation.\u2019 They added: \u2018We have seen a vast increase of awareness for Mike Ashley\u2019s failed ownership of Newcastle United in the local and national media and amongst fans who were previously resigned to apathy. \u2018These fans have now hopefully found a vehicle to express their profound dissatisfaction with the situation the club finds itself in, which is essentially one of a proud sporting institution transformed into a giant advertising vehicle.\u2019 And the protest \u2013 which is backed by the respected Newcastle United Supporters Trust \u2013 also plans to target Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct stores. The statement continued: \u2018Secondly, from 12:30pm on Saturday we will target Sports Direct stores within a 20-mile radius of St. James\u2019 Park and their flagship Oxford Street store by means of a peaceful protest. The supporters' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of Saturday's  match against Swansea. Fans boycotting the Spurs match hold banners demanding the resignation of Ashley as Newcastle director. Newcastle supporters have also been asked to take part in peaceful protests outside Sports Direct stores. \u2018Further details regarding this protest will be released\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience' - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all of Reading's future home and away matches. On Wednesday, Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he had no regrets about the incident, adding that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. The incident occurred during the Royals' 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final replay win over Bradford. 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Despite facing a potential banning order  Sumner was in good spirits outside Reading Magistrates' Court.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Washington (CNN)An Iranian military observation aircraft flew within 50 yards of an armed U.S. Navy helicopter over the Persian Gulf this month, sparking concern that top Iranian commanders might not be in full control of local forces, CNN has learned. The incident, which has not been publicly disclosed, troubled U.S. military officials because the unsafe maneuver could have triggered a serious incident. It also surprised U.S. commanders because in recent months Iranian forces have conducted exercises and operations in the region in a professional manner, one U.S. military official told CNN. \"We think this might have been locally ordered,\" the official said. The incident took place as the U.S. and other world powers meet with Iran in Switzerland to negotiate a deal limiting Tehran's nuclear program. At the same time, Iran has been active in supporting proxies in several hotspots in the Persian Gulf and neighboring regions. The Navy MH-60R armed helicopter was flying from the deck of the USS Carl Vinson on a routine patrol in international airspace, the official said. An unarmed Iranian observation Y-12 aircraft approached. The Iranian aircraft made two passes at the helicopter, coming within 50 yards, before the helicopter moved off, according to the official. The official said the helicopter deliberately broke off and flew away in a 'predictable' manner so the Iranians could not misinterpret any U.S. intentions. The Navy helicopter was in radio contact with the ship during the encounter, but there was no contact between the two aircraft and no shots were fired. The Navy crew took photos of the incident but the military is not releasing them. The U.S. administration is considering a potential demarche protest against Iran, the official said. CNN has reached out to Iranian officials but has not received a response. This type of Iranian observation aircraft generally operates over the Gulf several times a month. But after the recent incident, U.S. naval intelligence did not see it again for two weeks, leading to the conclusion that the incident may have been ordered by a local commander who was then reprimanded by higher-ups. The Pentagon has noted for the last several years that most encounters with the Iranian military at sea or in air are conducted professionally, but that some missions run by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces have been too aggressive against U.S. forces in the area. The U.S. military's concern has been that one of these incidents could escalate into a military encounter.

The 18-year-old, who was booked into Lower Buckeye Jail in Phoenix two weeks ago, is seen on surveillance video walking in a room he was not authorized to be in before being approached by two officers. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said that the two jail employees began telling the young man to go back to his cell before he began taking swings at them. Scroll down for video. An assault on an officer at a jail in Phoenix has left one officer in intensive care with brain bleeding. Above, the inmate is captured on video in a psychiatric ward area where he is not authorized. Officers including Scott Beaty (center) approached the unidentified 18-year-old inmate and told him to go back to his cell. The inmate then began punching Beatty and the other officer in the room, who used a Taser but could not subdue the young man. The unnamed inmate, who was not immediately affected by four taser shots, was eventually subdued by a large group of officers who came to the scene. Three detention officers were taken to a nearby hospital, and two of them had been knocked unconscious. Scott Beaty, a 15-year-veteran, was taken to the intensive care unit and will need reconstructive surgery after suffering a brain bleed and broken bones in his face. The inmate, who did not have any prior incidents of bad behavior, was not injured. After knocking Beaty to the ground, the inmate is seen attacking the other officer, who was also taken to a nearby hospital. More officers arrived on the scene where the assault took place, though additional taser shots did not immediately affect the 18-year-old. The unidentified inmate was eventually subdued by a group of officers, who saw their colleague knocked out on the ground after being hit repeatedly. 'Sometimes when you have a mental condition you fight and get super mad,' Arpaio said during a press conference, though he did not elaborate on the mental condition. Arpaio said he could not speculate on what led to the attack. The prisoner became'very violent' according to officials, and was reportedly fighting until he was put in lock down in the psychiatric ward, where he remains.

Obama's Iran diplomacy already has his conservative critics fired up, and things could get even more interesting in the week ahead. The President is headed to Panama for a regional summit, and Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports one of the big questions is whether he'll make history and have a face-to-face meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro. \"This would be the first meeting between a U.S. and a Cuban leader in decades,\" said Pace. \"But Obama's efforts to end this freeze of Cuba have been a lot more difficult than they looked when he announced it last year,\" Pace said.  \"And so what the White House is going to be weighing is whether this meeting would be a way to generate more progress or whether it would be a premature reward for the Castros.\" Hillary Clinton has leased her headquarters space in Brooklyn and will soon make her presidential campaign official. And with the launch, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reports, will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce Clinton -- with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children's issues. \"The Democrats around Hillary Clinton believe that while she's one of the most famous people in the world, she's never been properly introduced in her own right,\" said Martin. \"So when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks, look for more biographical touches.

This as many are still wondering what future the highly touted athlete will have in the NFL. Scroll down for videos. Johnny Manziel (above) has been released from rehab after entering a facility on January 28. This after Manziel's partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last July, with some worried his drinking was a priority. Manziel's hard-partying and off-the-field antics were well known while he was in college. According to ESPN, Manziel was 'doing great' in rehab, and had the full support of his team. Now comes the real test however, as he will be forced to compete with Josh McCown for the starting quarterback position, who just signed a\u00a0$14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons.

Especially after one incident last year when, after partying until well past midnight, Manziel, who is suffering from an injured hamstring, skipped out on a Saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept, and in turn was fined by the Browns. Manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior, saying; 'It\u2019s about being accountable... instead of looking like a jackass.' And while his season may have been over at that time, many believed Manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy, which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at FDR Lounge at the Delano in Miami on over the New Year holiday, alongside the likes of LeBron James and Ryan Phillippe, and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend Colleen Crowley and some buddies poolside at the Delano.

A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and\u00a0a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. In one case mother Lisa Parkisson, 35, also died 48 hours after giving birth to her son Zac in June this year. In another case newborn Thomas Beaty died from head injuries in April after medics forced him back into the womb during birth.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)It's time for liberals to look local. With Washington gridlocked over almost everything and congressional Republicans standing firm against any further expansion of domestic policy, the odds of Congress passing another New Deal or Great Society are minimal. It will take a lot of work by Democratic voters and activists to change the numbers on Capitol Hill so that liberal ideas stand a chance of passing. Yet at the state and local level, the story has been much different. Liberal Democrats have found more political space to move forward with their initiatives. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has launched an ambitious pre-K education program to broaden access for all of the city's residents. In New Orleans, the mayor has put together a generous housing program to guarantee that there are no veterans without shelter. The drive for same-sex marriage equality took hold in the states before reaching the federal level. States such as Vermont, Oregon, and Washington as well as New Jersey have taken the lead in adopting eco-friendly policies. While Congress has resisted President Barack Obama's call to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25, 21 states and the District of Columbia went ahead and enacted minimum wage increases of their own. This is just the tip of the iceberg. At the annual conference for New America in Washington last week, the focus was on innovation. The most exciting ideas are taking hold at the local level. As the Atlantic's James Fallows explained to the audience, when one moves beneath the gridlock of Washington and down to the towns and communities of America, it is quickly possible to see the \"functionality of politics\" -- where partisanship does not trump the need to solve problems. This has given liberals an opening. In Detroit, a company called Detroit Dirt is taking food scraps from local eating establishments and transforming them into compost for gardens to nurture communities and lower the environmental footprint of the city, Pashon Murray said at the New America conference. Jonathan Mintz, the founding president and CEO of Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, explained how his organization assists local governments to develop global partnerships that help lower- and middle-income Americans gain greater access to banking services. But many liberal Democrats are uneasy about embracing this trend. Since the New Deal in the 1930s, which followed the total collapse of the patchwork of local and state social welfare programs overwhelmed by the weight of the Great Depression, doing things at the national level has been seen as the only way to go. Only by making programs national could policymakers ensure that state and local government\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

An Army recruitment sergeant who served with the Special Forces in Iraq has denied sex attacks on 11 female cadets - saying they 'never happened'. Edwin Mee, 46, is said to have abused his position of power to abuse or rape 11 alleged victims while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London. The Scottish officer - known as 'Jock' - allegedly carried out the attacks on women aged from 15 to their early twenties between October 2010 and September 2011. Taking to the witness box to give evidence at London's Southwark Crown Court today, Mee told jurors about his military career, and firmly denied the allegations. He branded one alleged victim - who says she became pregnant after he raped her - a 'time waster' and a liar. Lisa Wilding QC, defending, asked her client: 'The allegations against you are that in respect of two complainants, that you raped them, and in respect of the others that you touched them sexually, what do you say generally about those allegations?' Mee replied: 'That never happened ma'am.' Mee joined the army aged 24, and went on to serve tours of duty in Iraq - where he was attached to the Special Forces, and Afghanistan - where he was attached to a parachute regiment - and Bosnia, jurors heard. By the time the allegations against him came to light he had acquired the rank of sergeant, and he was suspended in 2011. The court was told that Mee was medically discharged from the Army in April 2014. He explained that his father had been an engineer in the Royal Navy, his mother an Army nurse, and that his step-brothers had also been in the Army. Lisa Wilding QC, defending Mee, asked him how he felt about his time in the Army. He replied: 'Everyone knows how I feel about the Army. My family served in it - the Army was my life, and if it wasn't for all this mess, I would still be there.' When arrested, Mee gave a prepared statement to police denying the allegations against him.

A woman has been accused of stealing more than $100,000 worth of women's clothing which she then advertised on Facebook to sell from her plush mansion. Kelli Jo Bauer, 45, was arrested at her Kansas City home after undercover officers visited her and were allegedly shown dozens of clothes, many still with tags of them, that she was selling. Bauer, who lives in a $900,000 home in Overland Park had advertised more than 1,000 items of high-end women's clothing on Facebook, including dozens of fake designer handbags. She has been accused of theft, according to documents filed in Johnson County District Court. Bauer, who is on house arrest as a condition of bond, is accused of showing officers clothes \u2014 many with tags still on them \u2014 hanging on a rack and folded on a bed in an upstairs bedroom, according to the\u00a0Kansas City Star. It is alleged that Bauer told undercover officers there was more merchandise downstairs, including an 'armful' of purses she showed them. Bauer told the officers that she was selling the items because she was a 'compulsive shopper' and had lost weight, the court documents said. The officers bought several items, including what Bauer said was a fake Louis Vuitton bag for $50. Scroll down for video. Detectives who began following Bauer said they saw her stealing items from several stores. After her arrest, police spent two days searching her home and were seen removing several items in large black bags. Officers are continuing to catalogue the items they seized. Bauer was allegedly selling the designer goods from her sprawling mansion in Overland Park, Kansas City. Bauer was released on a $20,000 bond and ordered to stay out of retail stores. She was placed under house arrest, monitored by GPS tracking. According to state records, Bauer operates an online retail business named My Retro Baby. The site advertises everything from a $325 diaper bag to a $38 hooded baby robe. Bower had apparently told the undercover officers she was selling the clothes because she had lost weight.

The Stoke manager has kept the club's chequebook largely in his pocket since taking over in May 2013 but said he would splash out when the right player became available. Signing Begovic to a new contract is a priority given the Bosnia goalkeeper will be entering the final year of his current deal. Stoke City manager Mark Hughes is confident he will have money to spend in the summer transfer window. Hughes wants goalkeeper Asmir Begovic to agree a new contract at the Britannia Stadium. But Hughes will add expensive acquisitions if needed, having missed out on \u00a310million Xherdan Shaqiri in the January window. Hughes said: 'We haven't spent a great deal since I've been here.

'We've chased any number of players and some targets we've got very, very close to where we would have been in a position to make a decision whether or not we spent a significant amount. Stoke sit 10th in the Premier League and still have an outside chance of earning a European berth. Begovic is out of contract at the end of next season and could be targeted by clubs this summer.

Just hours before the party launched its women's manifesto, the Labour leader declined several chances to say that his deputy would get the second most powerful job if he gets to Number 10. The snub comes just three days after Miss Harman made clear that she intended to take the role were Labour to make it back into power. Ed Miliband today refused to confirm that deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman would become Deputy Prime Minister if Labour wins the general election. Miss Harman has previously suggested that Gordon Brown's refusal in 2007 to maker her Deputy PM was sexist. Today Mr Miliband also refused to guarantee her the role. He told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: 'Well she's the shadow deputy Prime Minister at the moment. 'I've made a sort of self-denying ordinance which is that I don't do what I call measuring the curtains, which is starting to presume the result of the election on May 7th. 'Harriet is an incredibly strong, incredible asset to our party, I can't say fairer than that, but I'm not going to start anticipating what might happen after the election.' His remarks will infuriate Miss Harman, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday that she intended to become Deputy Prime Minister. 'Well I'm Shadow Deputy Prime Minister and I hope that we'll get into government,' she said. Last year Miss Harman used a speech to criticise Mr Brown for not making her Deputy PM when she was elected Labour's deputy leader. 'Imagine my surprise when having won a hard-fought election to succeed John Prescott as deputy leader of the Labour Party, I discovered that I was not to succeed him as deputy prime minister,' she said. 'If one of the men had won the deputy leadership would that have happened? Would they have put up with it? I doubt it.'

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Modern humans have been blamed for killing off the Neanderthals by out competing them, breeding with them and even outright murdering them. But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of Africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video. Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the Natural History Museum in London, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to Europe by modern humans as they migrated out of Africa. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. A gene that can cause diabetes in Latin Americans is also thought to have come from Neanderthals, long before their ancestors colonised the New World. Another recent genetic study by scientists at the University at Buffalo has suggested that Neanderthals may have suffered from psoriasis and Crohn's disease, a condition that affects the digestive system. They speculate that pathogens like Heliocbacter pylori, the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, were brought to Europe by modern humans from Africa and may have infected Neanderthals, who\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

The staff all live out in Washington and commute in. The hours are long. Those on duty cannot go home until the President retires and goes to bed. So they see little of their families and are often divorced as a result. The pay is not great, but the job is prestigious and passed by personal recommendation among friends. Most of them have stayed there for 20 years or more.

While Williams held a massive 70-7 lead in winners, she committed nearly three times as many unforced errors as the 15th-ranked Errani. Until the very end, Williams struggled to dictate play against an opponent who had never before presented her with serious problems. Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday. Still, Williams improved to 20-0 this year and 16-0 in Fed Cup for her career. Next up, Brindisi-born Flavia Pennetta was facing 65th-ranked Christina McHale, followed by a potentially decisive doubles match. The doubles teams named were McHale and Alison Riske against Karin Knapp and Pennetta. But U.S. captain Mary Joe Fernandez has said that Williams will play doubles if the series is tied, in which case Errani would likely pair with Pennetta. Williams entered with a 7-0 career edge over Errani and had lost a total of four games in their previous two meetings. She usually dominates Errani by taking advantage of the Italian's weak serve but the wind prevented her from stepping too far into the court. Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves. The Circolo Tennis Brindisi is located next to the southern city's port and a sharp breeze was blowing off the bay. Williams and Errani often had to catch their tosses and start their service motions over again, or delay play when the wind whipped clay into their eyes between points. 'The wind helped me,' Errani said. 'Against a player like her it favored me.' Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world no 1's power proved to be too much. Already in the first three games of the match, Williams committed nine unforced errors as Errani played her usual defensive game and just tried to keep the rallies going. With the soldout crowd of 4,000 chanting her first name, Errani served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but Williams played solidly and then the American surged to a 6-\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Brian Cassidy was picking up trash outside the store in Bangor, Maine on Thursday when he discovered the wet stack of money beneath a large piece of paper in the parking lot. He immediately contacted store security to tell them what he had found and, realizing it was a sizable sum, they then contacted the police department, Sergeant Tim Cotton said. Officer Dustin Dow went to the store to take the report and learned that a man had visited the security office last winter to claim he had lost about $4,000 in the parking lot. Great work: Brian Cassidy, right, is pictured being presented with a Bangor Police Department Challenge coin by an officer after he found $4,400 cash in a Walmart parking lot and alerted security. The man, who was later identified as Ou Chen, said at the time that he had put the money in an envelope in his pocket after leaving work at a nearby restaurant. He had intended to send the money home to his family, Cotton said. But after clearing snow off his car and driving home, he realized that his pocket was empty. Chen went to the security office to ask if the money had been turned in or if surveillance footage had revealed what could have happened to it, but nothing emerged. When Dow heard of the story, he went to the nearby restaurant, Kobe Steakhouse, and asked for the man, and Chen confirmed he had misplaced the cash. After counting the money at the station, the officer returned to the restaurant to give it back to him - and to take a picture showing him gladly accepting it. Returned: The money belonged to Ou Chen, who lost the $4,000 as he cleared snow off his car last winter after leaving his job at a nearby restaurant. He told Walmart about it at the time but they could not find it. Stash: Cassidy found the money, pictured, while picking up trash near the Walmart parking lot last Thursday. Cotton applauded Brian for his honesty, particularly because the Walmart employee found the money while working at a job that does not pay much. 'Brian is not getting rich doing this and has dealt with other issues over the past year,' Cotton explained in a lengthy Facebook post.

Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under the Tories compared with just under 9 per cent under Labour and just over 9 per cent under the current Coalition. The figures, in an analysis for the Daily Mail by investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, are a further boost for David Cameron and George Osborne ahead of the general election on May 7. Ed Miliband is struggling to win over business men and women as well as investors who are worried about a Left-wing Labour government\u2019s attitudes to enterprise. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses this weekend showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government under Mr Miliband would be a \u2018catastrophe\u2019 for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors \u2013 including millions of workers saving for a pension \u2013 fare better under the Conservatives. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u2018The stock market has performed twice as well under a Conservative government as it has under Labour, according to performance statistics dating back to 1970.\u2019 The analysis shows that companies have also performed better under the Tories with profits up by an average of 11 per cent a year under the Conservatives and 6 per cent under Labour.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: We all need a helping hand sometimes, and nobody more so than Kecil the baby orangutan, who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him. But the one-year-old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother Maggie at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend. Maggie, 53, who has already raised one surrogate child, has proved herself yet again by helping to raise Kecil (pronounced Ka-cheel) for the past 10 months, and the two now have an inseparable bond. Scroll down for video. Taking care: Maggie, 53, wraps a protective arm around Kecil the baby orangutan who she has been raising for the past ten months after his mother and a surrogate mother both rejected him. Inseparable: Zookeepers were nervous that Maggie might reject Kecil after raising four of her own children and another surrogate which was given to her in 2002, but she has proved her parenting prowess once again. When the pair appeared in front of news crews earlier today, Kecil began crying after losing sight of Maggie for a few moments. But the elder orangutan quickly returned, at which point Kecil quietened down and scooted over to join her, reports the Chicago Sun Times. Kecil had to be moved from his birthplace at\u00a0Toledo zoo, in Ohio, 14 months ago after his natural mother failed to bond with him properly after birth. He was moved to\u00a0Milwaukee County Zoo and given to a second surrogate, but she did not form a bond with him either. In a final attempt to find a parent for Kecil, he was handed over to Maggie, the oldest orangutan in North America, who has already raised four children of her own, and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002. The pair immediately showed signs of intimacy, but zookeepers still faced a tense wait to see if the elderly orangutan would take on full parental duties. Nava Greenblatt, one of the zoo\u2019s lead primate keepers, said that the turning point came when a fire alarm sounded at the zoo a few weeks ago, frightening Kecil, who ran to Maggie and cuddle up to her.

I'm not a tribally political animal. I am someone who runs and starts businesses, but most importantly wants to see our country succeed. I back whatever works. Five years ago the world was facing catastrophic economic problems. We had stared into the abyss of a complete failure of the international financial system, and managed \u2013 via huge State intervention \u2013 to avoid total collapse. The recovery of the UK since then has been extraordinary. We have outperformed every other major economy. Former Blair ally Charles Dunstone (pictured) is now supporting the Conservative Party in the election. When I speak to investors and business people around the world, they see the recent British story as something of a miracle. The jobs figures alone are astounding: 2 million more people are in work \u2013 a figure representing many, many personal triumphs. Businesses are starting in record numbers. I really believe David Cameron and George Osborne deserve much of the credit for this incredible turnaround. But back to ten years ago. In 2005 I supported New Labour because they had ended the tyranny of 'or' \u2013 the idea that you could only have a strong and growing economy 'or' a fair and compassionate society. New Labour recognised that the one helped pay for the other; healthy tax receipts from business meant more money for schools, hospitals and helping the poorest in our country. Put simply, Tony Blair understood that in order to spend money, you first need to earn money. I'm genuinely concerned that this view isn't shared by the current Labour Party \u2013 and that business is viewed as the problem, rather than the essential engine that gives politicians the ability to provide that fair and compassionate society. What's more, they do not seem to understand how businesses work. Take their energy-freeze policy. This betrays a basic misunderstanding of how markets work. Companies would have elevated prices in anticipation of a freeze \u2013 and kept them high despite the recent drop in the price of oil. This is just one clumsy intervention that would end up costing people money. The current Government has made it very clear that the UK is open for business and endeavours to make business welcome here. It's vital, because fundamentally, the business world is driven by confidence and positive sentiment. The former Carphone Warehouse boss said Mr Cameron deserved credit for turning around the economy.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Radar images from Europe's Sentinel-1a satellite have revealed the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in unrivalled detail. The information from the satellites has been transformed into an interferogram, which provides a colourful and highly detailed view of the Earth's land mass. By comparing before and after images, scientists have discovered Mount Everest shrank by about one inch due to the land that was shaken in the natural disaster. The tallest point in the world, however, still stands at 29,029 feet, according to The Weather Channel. Additionally, an area 75 miles (120km) by 30 miles (50km) has lifted up 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around the capital, Kathmandu.

Each \u2018fringe\u2019 of colour represents about 3cm of deformation. The large amount of fringes indicates a large deformation pattern of 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around Kathmandu. Scene: A rescue chopper prepares to land, evacuating climbers from higher camps to Everest Base Camp, Nepal. New radar images have shown that Mount Everest shrank one inch following the Nepal earthquake this week. These are the first radar images to reveal the destruction caused by the 7-magnitude earthquake that killed 5,000 people and affected millions more. 'There's a peak of slip just to the northeast of Kathmandu,' Professor Tim Wright from the Natural Environment Research Council told the BBC. He explained that what scientists count are the coloured 'fringes' in the interferogram, of which there are about 34 from this quake. This translates to more than 3.2ft (1 metre) of uplift. To the north of Kathmandu, the interferogram suggests that the ground receded, and it also shows how a fault ruptured east from the epicentre, but did not break the surface. Combining two Sentinel-1A radar scans from 17 and 29 April 2015, this interferogram shows changes on the ground that occurred during the 25 April earthquake that struck Nepal. An overall area of 120x100 km has moved \u2013 half of that uplifted and the other half, north of Kathmandu subsided. Vertical accuracy is a few centimetres.

Pauline explains: 'Our relationship started off very well, she was a very nice person, if she could help you in any way she would. She used to come in and have a cup of tea, we became friends.'

It's been a blink-and-you-miss-it campaign, especially by U.S. standards, where candidates can take years to finesse their messages.

But that's all to come when polls close late Thursday evening, local time. Very strict rules govern the reporting of UK elections, but until they kick in, here are some things you should know -- who are the candidates, what are the issues, who's likely to win, why bacon sandwiches matter, what is \"UKIP\" and, if the Queen isn't in charge, what does she do? The Queen doesn't run Britain. Before we get on to the candidates, let's dispel one common misconception. Queen Elizabeth II is officially Britain's head of state, but she's only nominally in charge. She signs off on legislation and appoints new prime ministers but has no real power, so no beheadings but maybe a few disapproving stares. Officially, she's politically neutral.

Not only is he ready to spend another five years helping the Tories run Britain, he wants to replace George Osborne as Chancellor. 'Yes, I know,' he shrugs, acknowledging the apparent contradiction, 'I've spent my whole political life fighting the Conservatives.' How does he sit down with Tories he privately despises? 'When we have a business meeting we put the guns at the door and sit down and talk,' he smiles. He complains of 'nasty and vicious stuff' from the Tories. And after one heated Cabinet verbal exchange with Defence Secretary Liam Fox, Cameron rushed up to Cable on his way out and begged him to keep it secret to stop the Coalition collapsing. He describes another confrontation with junior Tory Business Minister Matt Hancock, an ally of Osborne sent to'spy' on Cable. 'He came to my office with a list of plum jobs he wanted. I said, 'No, I'm the boss.' He was very cross, stamped his feet, got up and slammed the door.' So how, and more to the point, why, does Cable want another five years of more of the same? 'Because I've realised it is possible to be business-like with them. I can envisage a scenario in which I would stomach working with the Tories if the situation required. You have to let your head rule your heart.' In the interview, Mr Cable said the Prime Minister\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

A new metro line extension opened this week in the Czech capital \u2013 transporting travellers closer to the airport than ever before \u2013 but the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses doesn\u2019t have a moving staircase. That means porters are left to carry travellers\u2019 heavy bags up and down the steep stairs at Nadrazi Veleslavin station, in north-west Prague, from 5am to 10pm every day, free of charge. Scroll down for video. Porters are carrying passengers' luggage up and down the stairs at\u00a0Nadrazi Veleslavin station every day. The construction project didn't budget for an escalator between the metro station and bus terminal. One of the porters, Radek Mojzis, a 23-year-old student at Prague's School of Economics, told the Associated Press that he applied for the job because he wants \u2018to stay fit and help the elderly.\u2019 Without a direct train connection, the No 119 bus takes passengers on the final five miles between Vaclav Havel Airport and the nearest metro station. More than three million airport customers use the bus every year, choosing not to go by car or risk being ripped off by one of Prague\u2019s notorious cab drivers. The 20billion koruna (\u00a3527million, $787million) metro extension, planned by the Prague Public Transport Company, was supposed to transform Nadrazi Veleslavin station into a transport hub for the airport, with passengers transferring to trains, not buses. Travellers can use a lift, but they are forced to cross a busy road to access the bus terminal. But the project is unfinished and the escalator that was constructed connects with an unbuilt train station. Michal Rehorek, a spokesman for the airport, told MailOnline Travel that the public transit authority is responsible for building a new escalator. He said the airport is in talks with transit officials and a private company regarding the refurbishment of buses that stop at the airport and better signage at the metro station.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)Fans of the late actor Paul Walker knew that watching him in \"Furious 7\" would be bittersweet. Even so, many moviegoers said the final scenes of the new film, which earned a record $146 million over the weekend, still packed an emotional wallop. \"Not gonna lie, I shed a few tears at the end of Furious 7. The tribute to Paul Walker was very well done,\" one woman said Monday on Twitter. Hers was just one of a flood of messages on social media from people who said they got choked up during scenes featuring Walker, who died at 40 in a car crash in November 2013, before filming on \"Furious 7\" was completed. To finish Walker's scenes, the makers of the movie used body doubles, computer-generated images and even the actor's brothers. But it was the ending that really got to moviegoers. In finishing \"Furious 7,\" the film's producers sought to retire Walker's character, Brian, while paying homage to his role in the blockbuster \"Furious\" action franchise. But they felt that killing him off might appear exploitative. \"If they had gone down the other path, I think I would have refused to finish making this movie,\" director James Wan told BuzzFeed. Instead, the movie's makers chose to \"retire Paul's character in the most sincere and elegant way (they) could,\" Wan said. Their idea was to have Brian retire from his dangerous, high-octane lifestyle out of a sense of responsibility to his growing family with girlfriend Mia, who is pregnant with their second child. A scene late in the movie shows him and Mia playing on a beach with their son while the crew looks on -- essentially saying goodbye. Then his longtime buddy Dom reminisces about their years together, leading to a montage of Walker scenes from the first six movies. The song that plays over the montage is  \"See You Again,\" a collaboration between Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth. Co-star Vin Diesel shared the video for the song late Sunday on his Facebook page, where it has more than 1.5 million likes. Fans on Twitter and Facebook mostly praised the movie's ending as a fitting tribute -- and an emotionally wrenching one. \"Man I don't care how tough u are or how gangsta u claim to be....the last five minutes had me choked up in the movie theater... I saw it 3 times in one day......the ending is the deepest ending I've ever seen,\" one man wrote on the movie\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Jeffrey Okafor, 24, of East Dulwich, south east London, is accused of stabbing Carl Beatson-Asiedu to death\u00a0outside a nightclub in the summer of 2009. The 19-year-old victim, known as DJ Charmz, had been leaving the Club Life Nightclub in Vauxhall's Goding Street, in London, with a group of friends after performing a set when a group of men approached them, the court heard. Carl Beatson Asiedu (left) was stabbed to death outside a nightclub by Jeffrey Okafor (right) who then fled to Nigeria on his brother's passport. Opening the trial, Sarah Whitehouse QC, prosecuting, told Woolwich Crown Court that three people had been specifically targeted in the attack including Mr Beatson-Asiedu,\u00a0a Francis Xavier College student who appeared in CBBC spy show MI High. Peter Lama, also 19, was stabbed in the buttock by Okafor's friend Abu Mansaray while Jermaine Coker was chased by Junior Ademujimi-Falade but escaped. Mr Lama managed to return to the club, where bouncers locked the doors and called the police. Minutes later, Mr Beatson Asiedu was seen staggering along Goding Street before collapsing in the road. His friends bundled him into the back of a car and rang for an ambulance, but police stopped the speeding vehicle as they struggled to find St Thomas' Hospital. He was pronounced dead at 5.36am, with a post-mortem examination concluding that he had died from a single stab-wound to his heart. Ms Whitehouse said: 'Carl Beatson wasn't so fortunate.' 'The prosecution say that Jeffrey Okafor was the person who drew a knife, stabbed him and killed him.' Okafor, who had no connection with his alleged victim, had been at the club with Ademujimi-Falade and another friend Bolaji Kako-Are. Ms Whitehouse continued: 'Junior Flade and Bolaji Kako-Are had also attended Francis Xavier College - the same college as Carl Beatson and Peter Lama.

Rosberg's criticism of Hamilton following Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix has reopened old wounds that at times festered between the duo last year. The 29-year-old German claimed Hamilton selfishly slowed during the middle part of the race, drawing him back into a chasing Sebastian Vettel in his Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton (right) insists he is prepared for further criticism from Mercede's team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton beat his Mercedes colleague to win the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on Sunday. Mercedes top brass Toto Wolff and Niki Lauda insist Hamilton was not at fault, with the eventual one-two the best result for the team. With Rosberg distinctly second best to Hamilton so far this season - as he has been out-qualified and out-raced by the Briton in all three grands prix - it remains to be seen what tricks he might have up his sleeve to stop the rot and regain the advantage. In Monaco last year it has been suggested by many Rosberg deliberately thwarted Hamilton during qualifying, earning pole and following up with the race win. In Belgium, Rosberg earned a rebuke and had sanctions imposed on him by the team after colliding with Hamilton on only the second lap which forced the latter out of the race. Hamilton (right) led Rosberg at the Chinese Grand Prix, and later came under criticism from his team-mate. The British racer, who leads the Drivers' Championship by 13 points, sprays champagne on a hostess. Although aware Rosberg may do all he can to beat him, an unperturbed Hamilton said: 'I feel pretty well prepared, having experienced all those kind of things. 'That stuff doesn't cross my mind. I think we're professional. We've been through some ups and downs and now we're in a good place. 'And anyway, I would like to think I am stronger this year and that will be reflected moving forwards.' The bottom line is at present Rosberg does not have an answer for Hamilton's form and pace as the 30-year-old has won eight of the last 10 races. Hamilton has also suggested Rosberg should seize a chance when it is presented to him, as was the case in Shanghai.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)The Golden State could soon refer to the hue of California's lawns. Gov. Jerry Brown on Wednesday imposed mandatory water restrictions for the first time on residents, businesses and farms, ordering cities and towns in the drought-ravaged state to reduce usage by 25%. \"We're in a new era,\" Brown said. \"The idea of your nice little green grass getting lots of water every day, that's going to be a thing of the past.\" The 25% cut in usage amounts to roughly 1.5 million acre-feet of water (an acre foot of water equals about 325,000 gallons) over the next nine months, state officials said. \"This historic drought demands unprecedented action,\" Brown said, standing on a patch of dry, brown grass in the Sierra Nevada mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow. The reduction in water use does not apply to the agriculture industry, except for the requirement that it report more information on its groundwater use. The exclusion prompted some criticism, as agriculture uses about 80% of California's developed water supply. Farms in the state have taken a hit, with reduced water allocations and thousands of farmworkers laid off. But climate writer Eric Holthaus of Slate wrote that \"wasteful agriculture is literally sucking California dry.\" The action comes as the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which Californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs, is near a record low. One famed golf course group said it should be able to keep its fairways and greens green. David Stivers, an executive vice president of the Pebble Beach company, said his company is studying the restrictions to see what effect it will have on business. \"It will not affect our golf course irrigation because we use recycled waste water (for golf course irrigation) from a plant we built in 1994,\" he said. The company operates Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill Golf Course and The Links at Spanish Bay as well as three hotels. He said the drought has yet to hurt revenue. \"People up here are also very conscious about water usage and the expense of water in this area,\" he said. Pepperdine University in Malibu, known for its beautiful campus, said it would be challenging to meet the restrictions given the water-saving practices already in effect.  The school already uses recycled and reclaimed water for campus irrigation and now it has turned off all fountains on campus, according to Rhiannon Bailard, director of the university's Center for Sustainability.

Of the 53 who were arrested in London, 16 were taken into custody, while 21 were released on street bail and asked to return to a station at a later date. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Anyone seen by an officer openly smoking cannabis in Hyde Park or in the Westminster area could be issued with a warning or face arrest.'

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: The Parole Board is reviewing the case of Colin Pitchfork, who\u00a0was jailed for life in 1988 on the basis of DNA evidence after raping and killing two schoolgirls. The Parole Board is reviewing the case of a murderer who was the first man to be convicted on the basis of DNA evidence. Colin Pitchfork was jailed for life in 1988 for raping and killing two schoolgirls. He strangled 15-year-old Lynda Mann to death after raping her on a deserted footpath in the Leicestershire village of Narborough in 1983. Three years later he raped and killed Dawn Ashworth, also 15, less than a mile from where he murdered Lynda. Pitchfork was finally caught two years later thanks to DNA tests on all the men in surrounding villages. He received a 30-year minimum sentence which was then cut to 28 years in 2009, meaning he was supposed to be eligible for release next year. A spokesman for the Parole Board said: 'We can confirm that the Secretary of State for Justice has referred the case of Colin Pitchfork to the Parole Board for a review of his suitability for release. 'If the Board does not direct his release, it has been asked to advise the Secretary of State on his suitability for open conditions (Category D prison).' Once a case has been referred to the Board, it usually takes around six months before a decision is issued, meaning the double murderer could be out this year. Pitchfork argued at his 2009 appeal against his sentence that the 30 years was'manifestly' excessive. He was jailed at Leicester Crown Court in 1988 after pleading guilty to two counts of murder, two of rape, two of indecent assault and one of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Announcing the decision to reduce the minimum term by two years in 2009, the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, said the appeal was being allowed to a'very restricted and limited extent relating to exceptional progress in custody'. He emphasised that the decision 'has no bearing whatever on the continuing effect of the sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant'. The judge added: 'He cannot be released unless and until the safety of the public is assured.' Former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge ruled in 2009 that Pitchfork should not be released until the public could be assured it was safe. After the world's first mass screening for DNA - where 5,000 men in three villages were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples - Pitchfork was eventually caught.

Notes from the top secret meeting between American and Russian officials in Germany last month have reportedly been seen by The Times. They suggest Russia is prepared to respond with force to the build up of Nato defence forces in the Baltic and by carrying out a wave of cyber attacks that can not be traced back to Moscow. The Kremlin officials - who were briefed by Russian Foreign Minister Segei Lavrov before the meeting and spoke of behalf of Putin - are said to have issued 'a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military' in response to the growing Nato army in the region. As well as the situation in the Baltics, two other potential flashpoints were reportedly identified that could lead to nuclear war between Russia and the West: the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and any future attempt to return the annexed Crimean peninsula to Ukraine.

The petition:\u00a0The move comes in response to an online petition posted on the White House website following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn with over 120,000 signatures. In a statement late Wednesday, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the administration supports banning so-called conversion therapy treatments for minors. 'We share your concern about its potentially devastating effects on the lives of transgender as well as gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer youth,' Jarrett said. 'The overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrates that conversion therapy, especially when it is practiced on young people, is neither medically nor ethically appropriate and can cause substantial harm.' The White House is not explicitly calling for Congressional legislation to ban the therapies nationwide. But Jarrett's statement highlighted states that have outlawed the practice and expressed hope that there will be broader action. The White House says lawmakers in 18 states have introduced legislation similar to measures already in place in California, New Jersey and Washington, D.C.

After being pushed by Patrick Lyttle, his brother retaliates with a single punch (left) which causes his brother to fall to the ground, his head snapping back and body crumpling (right) Barry Lyttle has been charged with grievous bodily harm and has pleaded guilty to the charge. Magistrate Graeme Curran said a jail sentence was likely, explaining 'the issue is whether or not I suspend a prison term'. Barry could spend up to two years in a Sydney jail, despite his brother's calls for the charges to be dropped. On Thursday, security footage was shown for the first time, revealing the details of the distressing altercation outside Hugo's Lounge in Sydney's Potts Point when Patrick received a single blow to the head during an argument with his brother Barry. In court on Thursday, Patrick comforted his inconsolable brother as they watched the footage.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: The French state railway company on Monday demanded police action against 'irresponsible' Paris-Roubaix cycle race riders who breached a safety barrier seconds before a high speed train hurtled by. The SNCF company made an official complaint to French prosecutors saying the action in Sunday's prestigious race had risked a deadly tragedy. The last of the riders went through the barrier in northern France about eight seconds before the TGV train arrived at the Waller crossing, 87 kilometers (54 miles) from the end of the so called 'Hell of the North' race. SNCF have spoken of their fury at the riders who breached a safety barrier as a train approached. SNCF slammed the riders for an 'extremely grave an irresponsible action' One rider was even clipped by the barrier as it came down, as the racers hurry through with the train near. Another cyclist made his way over the track after police tried to stop anymore competitors getting across. A number of riders wait safely for the train to pass through while others risked crossing. The train hurtled through at high speed shortly after a group of riders went through the barrier. One rider from the Belgian Lotto team was clipped by a barrier as it came down. John Degenkolb, winner of the race famed for its 26 sections of bone-jarring cobbled roads, was among the group who went through the barrier as it closed. Race organisers said it had not been possible for the leaders to stop in time. 'Several riders deliberately, and against all safety rules, crossed a closed safety barrier,' said a SNCF statement announcing the complaint to French prosecutors. 'Millions of television viewers saw live this extremely grave and irresponsible action which could have been tragic,' the company added. 'A few seconds later, a TGV ran on this line and could have hit the peloton.' When the last rider had gone through the crossing, a police motorcycle was in place to stop more riders going through. The riders are held at a level crossing in the Paris-Roubaix race as a train approaches. A number of cyclists breached the barrier to cross the track before the train sped through. The last cyclist appeared to cross the track around eight seconds before the train went through. Normally riders who go through a closed safety crossing are disqualified.

Lucas Leiva (right) celebrates with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after getting to the FA Cup semi-final. Lucas (left) challenges Markus Olsson as Liverpool beat Blackburn 1-0 in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. Lucas can play his first game at Wembley in a Liverpool shirt when they meet Aston Villa in the semi-final. 'Unfortunately I got an injury before we got to Wembley so I missed [the chance to play there],' he said. 'Hopefully I'll be fit and be able to play at Wembley. I've never played there, so it will be a very good experience and after many years here, to have that chance is amazing. 'I think everyone could see how hard we worked. We knew it was going to be a very hard game in difficult conditions, but I think we did well and we are so happy to get to Wembley and hopefully get to the final.' Victory over Blackburn intensified talk of the team giving captain Steven Gerrard, who departs for Los Angeles Galaxy, the perfect send-off as his birthday falls on the day of the final.

Luke Brett Moore was found guilty of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime and dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception in Goulburn District Court. Opening a freedom saving account with St George Bank in 2010, Moore was able to overdraw $2.189 million over three years, The Courier Mail\u00a0reported. NSW Police found Luke Brett Moore's haul after raiding his house back in December 2012. The 27-year-old Goulburn man was able to overdraw $2.189 million over three years from his St George Bank. Luke Brett Moore, 27, managed to live a life of excess despite being on social security because of a bank fault. He dipped into the account 48 times and spent the money on a number of expensive items. Moore's luxury haul included a Maserati, an Alfa Romeo, a power boat, a Michael Jackson autograph, a signed photograph of the Top Gear hosts and numerous paintings. To avoid being caught, the 27-year-old moved the funds to PayPal and National Australia Bank accounts. While Moore was spending up big, he was also receiving Centrelink payments between March and July in 2010, according to\u00a0Fairfax Media. Police seized a red Alfa Romeo. Moore was receiving Centrelink payments while he was overdrawing his account. To conceal his exploits, Moore moved the money into his PayPal account as well as into his National Australia Bank account. A framed Michael Jackson autograph with the late singer's photo and music CD was found in Moore's West Goulburn home. This is signed photograph of Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond. It has been more than two years since New South Wales police raided his West Goulburn home on December 12, 2012. There officers seized hundreds-of-thousands of dollars that the prosecutors said were funded by his exploits. Moore was soon charged but it took more than 26 months for him to be finally found guilty of the two offences. When the jury delivered their verdict, a family member who had come to support the 27-year-old broke down and had to be escorted from the court room. Sports memorabilia, including this Chicago Bulls jersey signed by former basketballer Michael Jordan, was also found in Moore's home. A power boat was also found among his luxury haul.

Previously they have beaten EU exports on a quarterly basis \u2013 or three months \u2013 but never for such a sustained period. The figures appear to vindicate David Cameron's'mercantile' foreign policy, which has seen him lead trade missions all over the world in order to refocus trade away from the EU's struggling economies. They are also a major rebuff to Tony Blair, who claimed in a speech this week that quitting the EU would cause'significant damage to our economy'. Meanwhile eurosceptics will seize on the figures as evidence that Britain could carve out a prosperous future outside the EU. The news that British sales to the rest of the world are surging ahead of those to Europe is a major blow to former Prime Minister Tony Blair's claim that leaving the EU would damage the economy. The figures appear to vindicate David Cameron's'mercantile' foreign policy, which has seen him lead trade missions all over the world. But total sales of British goods overseas have fallen to the lowest level for nearly five years amid warnings that the strong pound and weak eurozone are acting like a'straitjacket' on exporters. The slump will come as a setback for the Government ahead of the General Election next month. Britain has exported more goods to Europe than the rest of the world since the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. Exports to the Continent were worth \u00a3147.9billion in 2014 compared with \u00a3144.9billion to non-EU countries. But the gap has been closing in recent years as the crisis in the eurozone has hit demand for British-made goods and UK firms looked further afield for business. Exports to the EU in the three months to February were 7.4 per cent lower than a year earlier at \u00a334.4billion. At the same time, sales of goods stamped 'Made in Britain' to the rest of the world were up 4.2 per cent to \u00a337.9billion.

Killer pilot Andreas Lubitz researched suicide methods and cockpit door security before crashing his Germanwings plane into the French Alps, it emerged last night. German prosecutors said an examination of a tablet computer found at his apartment revealed he had recently used internet search terms such as cockpit doors and their security, and suicide methods. The revelations came hours after it was reported that Lubitz told doctors he was on sick leave rather than flying. It also emerged that the 27-year-old was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug so strong doctors have to warn patients of the increased risk of suicide. People who use Lorazapam are advised not to drive a car, let alone fly a commercial jetliner. Medical experts say it can also increase the risk of self-harm at the start of treatment. Prosecutors yesterday announced that the second black box from the flight had been found. It was said to be in a good condition and was likely to yield more information. Investigators believe Lubitz locked his captain out of the A320\u2019s cockpit on March 24 and deliberately crashed the plane, killing all 150 people on board \u2013 possibly because of suicidal tendencies or fears he may lose his pilot\u2019s licence. Citing sources from the investigation, German newspaper Bild reported that he sometimes lied to doctors that he was off work and wanted to get better so he could fly again. It said he gave them information about his job as a pilot and his employer, Germanwings, but concealed that he was still working. He was apparently more stable in recent years, but in the past few weeks had reportedly seen doctors three times for depression and an eye doctor over fears he was losing his sight.

'I thought what happened was really interesting. There was a journalist from one of our leading daily newspapers who made the comment you know, there's only one black.

This year is the time and the United Nations' international climate negotiations in Paris in December are the place to secure strong global agreement to curb heat-trapping emissions. A successful climate pact will send a signal around the world that a shift to a low-carbon economy is underway. The United States has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change. The U.S. administration on Tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.  This common-sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the U.S. economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more American energy jobs to power our homes and businesses. This is an area where the United States needs to lead, and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country. The United States isn't alone in this global climate effort. In a landmark joint announcement with the United States in November, China unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero-carbon energy to 20%. This shift will require substantial effort from China to retool its economy, increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal. As the world's No. 1 investor in renewable energy, China has already taken important steps forward. At the same time, India has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022, a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the United States has today. Cities and corporations are joining in as well. More than 200 cities, home to 436 million people, have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury. And more than a thousand companies, along with 73 countries, voiced support for putting a price on carbon and moving to cleaner energy technologies.

Jeffries finally agreed \u2018to respond to that portion of the white race that has been looking for me to defend its athletic superiority\u2019 \u2013 in return for a purse of $120,000 (worth more than three million dollars today). So racist was the press coverage of the build-up to the fight that even The New York Times wrote: \u2018If the black man wins, thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbours.' As the racial tensions grew, the sheriff of Reno took the then-unusual step of banning guns and alcohol in the 20,000 capacity arena erected down town. Jeffries, by then a contented farmer, had shed more than 100 lbs to get close to his old fighting weight.

The coroner's office said Krueger died of a gunshot wound to the chest. He was photo editor for the UK campus newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel. Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney Ray Larson would not say if there were other suspects, what the men are accused of stealing or how many weapons were used. 'I suspect that if there are other arrests the police will say that,' Larson said. 'I really am not going to talk about the facts of a pending case.

So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a \u2018no contest\u2019. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday. This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack \u2013 and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year\u2019s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger\u2019s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot. This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they\u2019re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form. A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years.

So the decision to enrol such a child on to a trial for largely untested treatments that may save them, but may make them suffer far more, is another kind of mental anguish altogether. Now, a ground-breaking television documentary filmed over two years follows three children and their families through such a situation. Battler: Chloe Ballouqui during her treatment. She is one of three children featured in a ground-breaking TV documentary. In the film they reveal with heroic honesty why they are willing to risk their lives as they become the first children in the world to go through a pioneering treatment called immunotherapy. Shocking as it might seem, this kind of \u2018experimentation\u2019 happens in Britain. And it is a necessary part of the process that discovers new treatments that ultimately offer hope to other young cancer patients. Sophie Ryan-Palmer, 12, Fabian Bates, nine, and Chloe Balloqui, three, are patients at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, the leading British centre for treatment of child cancers, and are the youngsters featured in the documentary. Tragically, although for one of them, treatment is successful, two do not survive the radical procedure. Immunotherapy involves powerful drugs being given to kill off all a patient\u2019s cancer cells and destroy their bone marrow. Loving life: Sophie Ryan-Palmer enjoying a party. The 12-year-old was two when she was diagnosed with leukaemia and entered the immunotherapy trial after her fourth relapse. This allows a transplant of new bone marrow containing immune system cells, harvested either from the patient or a donor. These cells are genetically modified in a laboratory so they are better at attacking cancer. Similar treatments have been carried out in America, and although the early results look hopeful, the risks are huge and many of the terminally ill young patients die from complications. The toxicity of the immunotherapy means children often have to be sedated and given strong painkillers such as morphine, to cope with the treatment, and many end up in intensive care. When presented with these facts, some parents decide the risks are simply to great, yet others choose to go ahead.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle. The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener. Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead. Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf. 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City. He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.'

Cook\u2019s problem has been opponents stopping him scoring in areas where he has always been prolific. He has struggled when he has looked to make runs with shots that he rarely employed before. Alastair Cook's innings into day three in Grenada was spot on, particularly the first hour of it. Cook worked his way to an encouraging 50 but frustratingly was out playing Shannon Gabriel on for 76. Yet it is nonsense to say a batsman who has hit 25 Test hundreds cannot drive the ball. Of course he can. The key for him is not to play the drive too early, when the ball is moving around and his balance at the crease is not quite right. Perhaps it has been playing too much one-day cricket, perhaps it has just been the pressure to score big runs again, but Cook has been searching for the ball far too early. Here he left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him, which took a lot of mental strength and composure. The drag-on was always going to be a danger on this pitch but Cook was right to try to play that shot because the cut is one of his big strengths. His eyes lit up when he was bowled a short, wide one by Shannon Gabriel. But the ball just lacked pace, Cook was through the shot too early, the angle from round the wicket tucked him up and the inside edge came into play. He cannot admonish himself for playing at the delivery. Boy, do I admire Cook\u2019s fortitude and the concentration he showed on that sluggish pitch with an incredibly slow outfield. The England captain hits behind square on the onside as Jermaine Blackwood ducks for cover. Cook left the ball outside off stump and made the bowlers come to him, but drove when the option arose. He is stronger mentally than anyone he will face, so he just has to carry on showing the same discipline. The bowlers will become bored before he does. The fact is, 76 here was pretty much worth a hundred in these day-three conditions, but sadly for Cook that is not how the record books will show it.

The 5,300-ton HMS Talent limped back to port with a huge dent and will be out of action for several months. Royal Navy top brass are investigating the incident. Last night, defence officials refused to disclose exact details of the crash \u2013 including where or when it happened \u2013 but they were adamant that HMS Talent struck \u2018floating ice\u2019 rather than a Russian sub. But the collision, which ripped a 6ft hole at the top of the conning tower, comes at a time of heightened tension between Britain and Russia in the airspace over the North Sea and beneath the waves. Britain is understood to be mounting frequent patrols of the North Sea and areas as far north as the Arctic Circle, while the Russians have increased their submarine activity by half in the past 18 months. Navy sources say the damage to the nuclear-powered submarine, which will cost as estimated \u00a3500,000 to repair, is consistent with striking an object while trying to surface. Surfacing can be a risky manoeuvre because sonar equipment on a submarine tends to look ahead for threats rather than above. In addition, radar scanners do not work underwater. After the crash, engineers from HMS Talent\u2019s 130-strong crew found that the impact had devastated the submarine\u2019s outer layer of acoustic tiles. These square-shaped 2in-thick tiles minimise the vessel\u2019s transmission of sound waves and other signals that could reveal her position. The Royal Navy\u2019s explanation that HMS Talent struck ice was also used to explain damage to British submarines during the Cold War which was later found to have been caused by enemy vessels. In 1981, the crew of HMS Sceptre were ordered to say they had hit an iceberg after their collision with the Russian submarine K-211. HMS Talent, which was launched in 1988, is a \u2018hunter-killer\u2019 submarine used to attack ships and other submarines, and also to perform a surveillance role. She is fitted with Tomahawk cruise missiles, cameras and thermal imaging periscopes. In 2009, she suffered loss of primary and alternative power supplies to her nuclear reactors.

Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park near East Grinstead has been lovingly upheld to how its first owners intended it in the 19th Century. With wood paneling on indoor ceilings and a large veranda at its front, the unique property is one of the first ever bungalows built in the country. It has gone on the market for \u00a3985,000, with historians eager to put it forward for listing to further protect its heritage. Pleasaunce Cottage in Dormans Park in East Grinstead has gone on sale for almost \u00a31million. The property is one of the last surviving bungalows in Britain that were built on the design of Victorian houses in India. An early photograph of the house shows how it has been lovingly preserved by its owners since its construction in the late 19th Century. Inside, original oak panelling adorns the ceilings and walls. The double height living room is one of the house's main features with a quirky gallery serving as a make-shift office. A sketch of the property's main sitting room shows how its Victorian design has been maintained to how architects originally intended it. Built in the 1880s by RA Briggs, known as Bungalow Briggs, the property is not all split over one level as modern bungalows are today. At the time the term was used to describe small, country homes used by the wealthy upper classes as a retreat to escape the heat of pulsing Indian cities. The design soon infiltrated British architecture. Briggs, a renowned architect, published his interpretation of the style in the 1891 book Bungalows and Country Residences. A hallmark of the traditional Indian-Victorian bungalow was a large veranda at the front of a property like the one found at Pleasaunce Cottage. Set over 2,542sq ft, the house has four bedrooms, four reception rooms and a cellar.\u00a0The main sitting room is double height with a gallery and the original inglenook fireplace. Its current owner has lived in the property for more than 30 years, having bought the house in 1983. Unlike bungalows as they are referred to today, the property is set over three levels. The original term was not exclusive to one-storey properties, instead referring to mountain retreats favoured by the Upper Classes.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Patties Foods says its testing has found no link between its Nanna's brand frozen mixed berries and a national hepatitis A outbreak. The health department continues to investigate how 34 people in six states contracted the hepatitis A virus, all of whom consumed the same brand of frozen mixed berries. Patties Foods said no hepatitis A virus or E.coli were detected in any sample of its recalled and non-recalled Nanna's Mixed Berries 1kg product during its own testing. Managing director and CEO Steven Chaur said the company's microbiological and viral testing does not confirm any link between Nanna's Mixed Berries and the virus and shows no systemic failure of its quality assurance programs. Scroll down for video. Four adults, three in Victoria and one in NSW, have contracted potentially deadly Hepatitis A after condsuming the 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries. The product contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. But he said Patties Foods remains guided by the health department's epidemiology, with the 1kg product remaining off supermarket shelves until further notice while the company evaluates alternative supply sources. 'If our Nanna's product was the source, the lack of laboratory findings from the testing conducted by Patties Foods for the presence of E.coli, Coliforms or HAV indicates there has been no systemic failure,' he said in a statement on Wednesday. 'Regardless, Patties Foods has significantly increased protection measures to ensure that any risk is further minimised in future.' No evidence of HAV or E.coli was found in re-tests of all batches of frozen berries that were not subject to the recall. Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. The company said one of two opened sample packs from consumers who contracted hepatitis A did test positive for HAV in health department testing but it may have been open to contamination. A trace amount of HAV was detected in one of eight random sample packs from supermarkets but the department noted that only demonstrated the virus was present, not whether it was alive and could cause infection, the company statement said. A health department spokeswoman said its investigation is ongoing with the source of the hepatitis A virus still unconfirmed and the same brand of frozen mixed berries the only common exposure for all cases.

Four times on the spin he suffered defeat as Newcastle manager in Tyne-Wear derbies.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: When you consider 80 per cent of our information about the outside world comes through our eyes, it's hardly surprising studies show eye contact to be the most effective way to signal sexual interest. Eighteen times more sensitive than our ears, our eyes are capable of responding to one and a half million simultaneous messages. So finely tuned, they'll subconsciously spot when someone starts looking at us - even if we haven't noticed - and start taking mental notes. Scroll down for video. Tracey Cox says that it takes more than just simple eye contact to get someone's attention here she gives her advice on how to use your peepers to get someone's attention. If that person is checking everyone out, they'll stop registering the information; if it's just us they're interested in, they'll signal the brain to give us a nudge that someone's watching. Spring is the season for flirting so the perfect time to find out the five eye contact techniques that are scientifically proven to get you noticed! THE FOUR-AND-HALF SECOND SCAN. A normal face scan lasts three seconds, scan for four-and-a-half and it's clear someone has 'caught your eye'. Eye contact of more than ten seconds between two people means one of two things: you're about to fight or have sex (well, you want to anyway). Prolonged eye contact produces intense emotional reactions regardless of whether it's a fist or a pair of lips heading your way. It activates the nervous system, raises our heart rate and blood flow and stimulates the production of certain hormones. On average we scan a face for three seconds, scan for four and a half to register your interest. THE SLIDE AND SETTLE. Studies have shown this to be an almost foolproof way to find out if a stranger is interested in you. Let your eyes settle on someone so they're aware you've noticed them, then as they're still watching you, slide your eyes around the room before settling back on them again. This effectively says, 'You instantly attracted me and you're still the pick of the room even after I've checked out the competition.' If they're interested, most people drop their eyes straight down, then directly up again to lock eyes after a few seconds. If someone's eyes instead slide away from yours and don't return after a minute or two, they're almost definitely not interested. Tracey says the simple act of blinking can also make someone aware that you're attracted to them. It's a quick movement\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Hall now risks arrest if he enters the area, where each of his terrified victims lived, at any time in the next five years. Jailing him for two years after he admitted two attempted burglaries and one burglary, Judge Martin Rudland said he had 'deliberately targeted vulnerable women' scaling the walls of buildings 'like a cat burglar of old' in a series of 'highly suspicious offences'. Hall stole nothing from the victims.

The man accused of shooting two police officers during a demonstration in Ferguson has confessed to the crime in a series of phone calls from jail that were recorded. Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief. All inmates are informed their phone conversations while behind bars are recorded and can be used as evidence against them, but despite the warning Williams spoke freely about the incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center. In a conversation with his girlfriend, Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD on the night of the shooting. 'Nobody aiming at no police,' Williams said. 'I ran up the hill and he (an unidentified person) shot at the car.... I shot back,' Williams said in the recordings first obtained by KMOV-TV. In another conversation, Williams expressed concern about a possible lengthy prison sentence. 'Even though I was in the wrong, though, I should have just went the other way,' he said. 'Oh man, now I'm looking at 10 years.' Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest. Despite being warned that phone calls from prison can be used as evidence, Jeffrey Williams, 20, spoke freely about the March 12 incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center. Christmas told The Associated Press on Wednesday morning he hadn't heard the audio of the phone conversations, but he stood by what Williams told him. 'My client has maintained to me that he never fired a gun that night,' Christmas said. 'So until I'm able to see evidence that I can distinctly talk to him about, I have to maintain my commitment to the statements that he has made to me.' Christmas was also critical of the justice center for releasing audio that provides potential evidence against Williams. Ferguson has been a focal point since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. A grand jury in November declined to indict the former officer, Darren Wilson, who also was cleared of civil rights violations by the U.S. Department of Justice in March.

Price told Daily Mail Online that when she was still in the hospital ward, she was told by doctors her baby, which was prematurely born, had died. The details she was given were very vague, and she said she was told the baby's twin had died, too, even though she had only had a single-child birth. The hospital had a big maternity ward, she said, adding that she had seen women nursing the wrong babies while she was there. 'There's a lot of information they should have given me,' Price said. 'I still have a lot of questions.' Friends of Gilmore's foster parents revealed to Price this week that her daughter had spent six months in an incubator before being taken to the family who adopted her. Her foster parents have since died, but Price said it was heartwarming to know that she grew up in a good home. 'She ended up in a family of love. They cared for her so much,' Price said. Gilmore, who lost her hearing when she was three years old after a childhood illness, said meeting her biological mother - her father has passed away - is something she's wanted for a long time.

Alpha Delta President Ryan Maguire said members are disappointed and exploring options. Booted out:\u00a0A Dartmouth College judicial committee has 'derecognized' Alpha Delta after several pledges\u00a0received brands on their backsides. Regardless of the outcome of an appeal, Inge-Lise Ameer, interim dean, has the authority to withdraw recognition of Alpha Delta. She's taken evidence from the committee under advisement. Attorney George Ostler said last month Alpha Delta acknowledged a small group of members voluntarily chose to get brands on their backsides, but said the practice - which he compared to a form of self-expression akin to piercing and tattoos - was never a condition of membership and has since stopped. A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a whistleblower. By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'. When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker first reported last month. Toga! The 46-year-old Greek organization partly inspired the 1978 National Lampoon's Animal House starring John Belushi (pictured center) He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected.

Freeze your cake for 24 hours straight from the oven and the sponge will be bouncier than ever. After being frozen for 24 hours, the sponge will be even bouncier because this process boosts the moisture, so you get an even creamier and softer centre.

When you are ready to tuck in, defrost for up to three hours, until thawed. HERBS AND SPICES. Keeping fresh herbs in the freezer will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process. Once defrosted, it also makes them softer, so all their lovely juices seep out more readily and the flavours are more potent.

In the operation's year-long existence, the Italian Navy and Coastguard had rescued an estimated 100,000 people. But it proved expensive and politically contentious, and Europe was not prepared to help Italy shoulder the burden of the crisis. Without European support, the Italian government cut back the naval assets dedicated to rescuing migrants. Mare Nostrum, which had been launched after some 600 people died when two migrant ships sank in 2013, was replaced by the more modest \"Operation Triton,\" under the auspices of the European Union's border agency, Frontex. Triton has about one-third of the funding of Mare Nostrum, with just six ships and patrol boats, two planes and one helicopter. It was designed as a policing rather than a humanitarian mission. At its inception, Klaus Rosler, operations director for Frontex, said \"Triton is not a replacement for Mare Nostrum.\" Nor was Frontex \"a coordinating body for search and rescue operations.\" Six months later, the argument about how to handle unprecedented numbers of desperate people heading for Europe continues unabated. Contributors to Triton include Portugal, the Netherlands, Finland and Iceland. Britain -- for example -- is not. It argues that search and rescue operations in international waters are \"an unintended 'pull factor,' encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths.\" It's perhaps no coincidence that immigration is a hot-button issue in Britain, with the UK Independence Party attacking the Conservative-led coalition government for being soft on allowing foreigners into the country. Similarly, the opposition Northern League in Italy opposed Mare Nostrum, accusing it of enticing migrants. If the first few months of this year are any guide, demand has not diminished even if the prospect of being rescued has. People from Syria, Mali and Eritrea are among the tens of thousands trying to escape repression, violence and abject poverty. Despite the danger, the great majority head first for Libya, where the collapse of authority allows smuggling operations to go unhindered. Italy -- the European state whose territory is closest to Libya -- has borne the brunt of the task of picking up, sheltering and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants.

A 24-year-old rehab worker killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas was an 'innocent bystander' who had been trying to aid two women who had approached her in the street. Cassandra Cassidy had been stopped outside the addiction recovery centre where she worked shortly after 10pm on Friday by two females 'afraid of males in a car', police have said. The fashion design student was shot as a car occupied by multiple people drove past while she was talking to the women, and died in hospital shortly afterwards. Ms Cassidy had just arrived for her late-night shift at a half-way house for people struggling with substance abuse, when the women approached her, Las Vegas police said in a statement. The women later told police they had been afraid of two men in a car down the street and asked to use Ms Cassidy's phone to call for help. A white, two door car with several occupants drove up to Ms Cassidy's car and fired several rounds, striking Cassidy but not the two women, before it sped off, Lt. Jeff Goodwin of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said. The aspiring designer, who had recently launched her own vegan clothing label, was mortally wounded and taken to University Medical Center where she died. The death of Ms Cassidy, who described herself as 'a 24-year-old fashion design student,  artist, geek, photography enthusiast, hiatus model, and many other things' on her Instagram page, has devastated family and friends. Her boyfriend of two years,\u00a0Adam Loghides, 26, said working at the rehab centre was a perfect fit for her, as she 'always finds the best ways and finds the best qualities in people'. The International Academy of Design & Technology-Las Vegas's student, was 'an avid supporter of civil rights and LGBTQ issues and someone who represented fairness on all levels and equality,' Mr Loghides told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Fed up of your neighbor's dog barking? It seems you could be in for a windfall. A couple in Oregon have been awarded $240,000 compensation for more than a decade of disquiet. Dale and Debra Krein of Rogue River filed a suit in 2012 against their neighbors and their giant Tibetan mastiffs. Winners! Debra and Dale Krein (pictured) have been awarded $240,000 after complaining that their neighbors' Tibetan mastiffs have caused them more than a decade of disquiet by barking until 5am. Overruled: John Updegraff and Karen Szewc (above)  tried to argue they needed the dogs for their livestock. Finally, after three years of proceedings, a jury has ruled in favor of the disgruntled Oregonians, ordering for the canines to be debarked within 60 days. Debarking is a surgical operation that reduces tissue in the vocal chords. The procedure lowers the volume of a dog's bark. The Kreins claimed their lives have been plagued by the noise since the defendants, John Updegraff and Karen Szewc, started breeding dogs in 2002. According to the Mail Tribune, the canines would routinely bark until 5am and throughout the day outside the property just 300 feet from the Kreins. The jury ruled that the Tibetan mastiffs (stock image), born in 2002, should have their vocal chords removed. Irritation: The Kreins' property (right) is less than 300 meters from Updegraff and Szewc (center), who claim to keep livestock on their sprawling land. The jury ruled their dogs were unsuited to protecting livestock. This continued, they told the court, despite the fact that Updegraff and Szewc were cited by Jackson County Animal Control in 2002 and 2004 for violating public nuisance codes. The defendants attempted to argue that the mastiffs were needed to protect their livestock. However, on Thursday a judge at Jackson County Circuit Court ruled the animals were not suited to the role.

The Clarets head to Goodison Park having beaten Manchester City, drawn against Tottenham and being narrowly defeated by Arsenal in the last month. They remain two points from safety but Martinez believes the fact they have been scrapping to get out of the bottom three all season - much like his Wigan side in the four seasons he spent with them before joining the Toffees - gives them an advantage over teams who have been dragged into the race for survival. Roberto Martinez (left) says Burnley's player remind him of his old Wigan side when they avoided the drop. 'You always see similarities,' said the Spaniard when asked for comparisons with his experience of the Latics' relegation battles. 'I don't think there is any fear of relegation and that is the biggest difference Burnley have over other teams who are not in the relegation zone who are starting to think they have something to lose. 'Burnley have shown to every team they play on the front foot. 'Physically they do not show they have been involved for nine months in this competition; it is the opposite as they are getting used to the demands of the Premier League and they look a strong team physically. The Spaniard masterminded Wigan's escape from relegation which seemed an almost impossible task. 'When you are in a situation as clear as the one they have now with the points they have, they are only one step away from getting away from the bottom three and that is an incredible incentive.' Martinez was criticised for not changing his approach during Everton's difficult run a couple of months ago but he stuck to his principles and he believes Sean Dyche's clear plan will help Burnley survive. 'Sean has been an incredible leader and has set very good direction for his team,' he added. 'When you get into a new league you sometimes don't get positive results after having a successful season in the Championship and you can start having doubts and wanting to change week after week. Sean Dyche has installed a fearlessness into his squad and Martinez praised his weekend opponent. 'Your own approach becomes your biggest problem but Burnley have been an incredible source of clarity, knowing what they are and how they want to achieve success and they are enjoying the best period of their season in terms of being consistent with their performances.

After weeks of gradual recalls, the company recalled all its ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet and other frozen treats sold in 23 states because they could be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, the company said Monday. The bacteria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, the elderly and others with weak immune systems. The CDC recommends consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products. Three people in Kansas have died in the past year and 10 people in four states have fallen ill from the bacteria believed to have come from Blue Bell products, the CDC said Tuesday. One person became sick in Arizona, five in Kansas, one in Oklahoma and three in Texas, the CDC said. People first became sick in January 2010, the CDC said. The agency connected patients from 2010-2015 to the current outbreak through comparisons to a database of bacteria DNA. The origin of the strain is still unknown, but \"the fact that it was the same strain over the last five years suggests it could have lurked somewhere in the factory the whole time,\" said Dr. Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the CDC Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases. Tauxe said there may be more people sickened by listeria than the CDC knows about. The \"rough estimate\" is one more case exists for every case the CDC hears about, he said. \"There may be cases that never got diagnosed and we are looking at the patterns, the DNA patterns, to guide us to which cases might be related,\" he said. \"If tomorrow someone found another completely different pattern from (Blue Bell) ice cream products, we'd be looking to see if there were related cases to that as well.\" Tauxe said the listeria strains found in Texas are different than those found in Oklahoma. \"It looks to us like there was one group of closely related strains related to ice cream from one factory and another different group related to a different factory,\" Tauxe said. \"We don't think something contaminated both factories.\" Blue Bell decided to yank all its products after tests showed some half-gallon containers of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream contained listeria. \"This means Blue Bell has now had several positive tests for Listeria in different places and plants,\" the company said in a written statement. \"At this point, we cannot say with\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

The 49-year-old, who worked at the jail for eight years and was commended for bravery, said some workers would even stay and watch the battle unfold, while others 'turned a blind eye to it'.

Mr Hiett told\u00a0The Sunday People: 'It was like a sport for them. If two inmates had a grudge they'd put them together in a room to sort it out. 'They only stopped when one was knocked out or couldn't defend themselves any more.' His revelations come after he left the prison in January last year, amid claims he was forced out for trying to lift the lid on the goings-on. He claims the in-fighting was often kept hidden from the overriding authorities, with the prison's management setting up a Behaviour Management Group to 'fiddle the assault figures'. He said common tactics were to treat group attacks as just one assault and to encourage inmates to admit to the lesser charge of health and safety over assault.

'And if they saw another gang member all hell broke loose \u2013 their wars don't stop when they're behind bars.

Pressure on the education system has intensified following a baby boom and continued migration, forcing schools to boost class sizes and classrooms - but say they may not be able to continue doing so. Its analysis of official figures indicates that by September next year, two in five local authorities in England will have more children ready to start school than there are places. This will increase to more than half by 2017\/18 and to three in five by the following year. It comes after the head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw warned last year that schools were struggling to cope with growing numbers of migrant pupils. \u2018When they\u2019re faced with an influx of children from other countries, they need the resources and capacity to deal with it and if those resources aren\u2019t there, that\u2019s a big issue for government,\u2019 he said. In 2013, a leaked paper prepared by the Department for Education revealed a steady increase in the number of babies being born has helped fuel the crisis. The LGA said that councils have created more than 300,000 primary school places since May 2010, with many increasing class sizes.

For while the 21-year-old American was chewing up golf\u2019s most spectacular course, the teenager from Scotland was suffering the role in reverse. Neil earned his invitation to the Masters after winning the Scottish Boys Championship in 2013 and then the British Amateur Championship last year. Bradley Neil finished 13 over par after competing in his first Masters. Still an amateur, the 19-year-old is being tipped for huge things when he does turn pro by no less a star than world No 1 Rory McIlroy. And he had the calming influence of veteran fellow Scot Sandy Lyle playing alongside him as he stepped on to the first tee hoping to recover from a six-over-par round on day one. There was promise as he atoned for hoisting his drive into the trees alongside the fairway with a recovery shot that put him 30 feet from the hole. But three putts later on the first of Augusta\u2019s lightning fast greens, memorably described by Peter Alliss as \u2018like trying to roll a ball down the bonnet of a car and stopping it before it falls off\u2019, reality was beginning to bite. The young Scot has been tipped for big things by the likes of Rory McIlroy. He did birdie the par-five second, but then came five more dropped shots to reach the turn in 41, and the youngster finished the day on 79, 13 over par in all and facing the truth that his big weekend was already over. \u2018I\u2019d prepared well for this, but it shows my game is not good enough yet,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I need to work hard on it if I want to get back here. \u2018I\u2019m jealous that Sandy gets to come back here every year, and I also want to do that in the future.\u2019 Lyle, who won the green jacket in 1988 as one of the two major wins of his career, is 57 and a student of traditional hickory clubs \u2014 he won the World Hickory Open at Carnoustie last year.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: The first signs of dark matter interacting with a force other than gravity may have been found. Until now it was thought that dark matter did not interact with anything other than gravity, earning it its \u2018dark\u2019 moniker and making its detection incredibly difficult. But the discovery of a \u2018clump\u2019 lagging behind a galaxy suggests that it may not be as oblivious to our universe as we thought. Durham University scientists studied a 'clump' of dark matter that appears to be lagging behind its galaxy - suggesting it interacts with itself. In this Hubble image, the lagging clump can be seen on the left of the central cluster. The distribution of dark matter in the cluster is shown with blue contour lines. Dark matter is confusing because it interacts with nothing - including itself. This is despite seeming to account for 85 per cent of the universe\u2019s mass and having an observable effect on galaxies: without dark matter, our galaxies would \u2018fall apart\u2019 as they spin. Aside from gravity, though, dark matter seemed to just pass through the universe without interacting with any other mass, such as humans, planets or stars. Now an international team of researchers at Durham University has found a clump offset from a galaxy by 5,000 light-years, suggesting that is not the case. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up 85 per cent of the matter in the known universe. When it comes to the total energy in the universe, though, it's a different story. Astronomers have found that the total mass\/energy\u00a0content of the universe is split in the proportions 68 per cent dark energy, 27 per cent dark matter and 5 per cent 'normal' matter. Dark energy is an unknown force across the whole cosmos that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the universe. So the 85 per cent figure above relates only to the fraction of'matter' that is dark. The discovery was made around one of the galaxies in the Abell 3827 cluster, 1.3 billion light-years away.

The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests with hundreds of bereaved parents, many with their heads shaved and clad in white mourning robes, marching 22 miles to Seoul from their home town of Ansan last week. President Park Geun-Hye has pledged to 'actively consider' raising the Sewol, taking into account the opinions of the relatives and salvage experts.

Lawyer Alan Dershowitz  was accused of having sex with minors with help from billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Buckingham Palace denied the allegations, which surfaced in a court filing in January. So did Dershowitz. In his decision, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra denied a motion by the alleged victims -- \"Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\" -- to join a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating their rights by negotiating a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without consulting them. Marra wrote in the decision that the \"lurid details\" of alleged abuse were unnecessary to determining whether the victims could join the lawsuit. \"The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim... especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.\" Speaking of the allegations against him, Dershowitz said Tuesday: \"I hope that people will now understand that they were completely false and made up, and, nobody should believe them.\" Buckingham Palace, which in January emphatically denied any form of sexual contact between the Duke of York and a victim it identified as Virginia Roberts,  said Prince Andrew was informed of the latest developments. \"He is spending this week privately, before resuming his schedule of public engagements next week.

Members of the university council ordered that the bronze sculpture was removed, after hearing its presence made black students feel uncomfortable and was seen a symbol of historical white oppression. The defaced statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes is tied by straps to a crane before its removal at the University of Cape Town. It follows weeks of protests at the university over the symbolism of the statue. The monument has been vandalised in recent weeks. It has not yet been decided where it will be moved. The government has backed the move, and Sandile Memela, the spokesman for the arts and culture ministry, said they are working to see if the country can take an \u2018official position\u2019 on statues and other colonial symbols. \u2018It marks a significant\u2026 shift where the country deals with its ugly past in a positive and constructive way\u2019, he said to press agency AFP, adding the government did not encourage the violent removal of statues. But the decision to move the monument of Rhodes \u2013 a 19th century imperialist who critics say helped pave the way for apartheid \u2013 has sparked protests in itself. On Thursday morning, the youth wing of white Afrikaner solidarity group AfriForum handed a memorandum to parliament in Cape Town to \u2018demand protection\u2019 for their heritage. The same statue was covered in plastic bags after protests by students and staff at the university in March. The university's council heard that black students felt uncomfortable because of the bronze monument. Politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes is called a 'racist' by his opponents. Born in 1853, he made his fortune in diamond mines, and entered into politics as an outspoken supporter of colonialism. He later founded Rhodesia - modern-day Zimbabwe - which was named after him. He believed England was the'master race', and wanted to draw a'red line' railway from Cairo to Cape Town for the British Empire - spanning the entire continent of Africa. While his supporters say he brought political and physical infrastructure to South Africa, others say his actions laid the groundwork for apartheid by restricting the rights of black Africans to work.

The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. Russian-made RD-180 engines currently power ULA's Atlas rocket, but Congress banned further imports as part of trade sanctions enacted after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. ULA said the new rocket's first stage will be powered by a pair of liquid-oxygen and liquefied methane engines under development by Blue Origin. Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno told a news conference in Colorado that the engines will be designed to return to Earth, so they can be refurbished and reflown. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX.

ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to grab them mid-air.

This is roughly half the cost of ULA's current Delta 4 Heavy rocket.

In a move that will be applauded by many, and is sure to dismay those accustomed to seeing scantily-clad beauties posing next to cars before a race, the FIA-backed series is adopting a more progressive stance. 'From Silverstone next week, you will see that for any race we will do - no grid girls like in the past,' WEC chief executive Gerard Neveu said after a presentation on Thursday for the opening Silverstone six-hour race. The world endurance championship have announced that there will be no more 'grid girls' before races. The decision by the FIA is seen as a progressive one by those in a male-dominated sport. 'For me that is the past. The condition of women is a little bit different now,' he said. The use of models, also referred to as 'race queens' or 'umbrella girls', to stand by cars with flags or placards displaying drivers' numbers has long been a feature of Formula One. It has also been a bone of contention for those seeking more equality and less sexism in a male-dominated sport, although in some series where women racers have joined the grid the 'umbrella' role has been taken by a man. The Hawiian Tropic Girls arrive on the grid before the start of the Le Mans 24 Hour Race in 2001. Toyota's world champion Anthony Davidson said it was about time things changed. 'I talk about this with my wife quite a lot, and we both agree it's actually pretty backward,' the Briton, who has also raced in Formula One, said. 'It's old school to have such a concept as grid girls. Surely the world's moved on? And motor racing should follow quite closely what the rest of the world's doing in that respect.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Some tour guides will do anything for a good tip. In the Australian outback, if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local Emus, you need a guide who will get down and dirty... apparently. In a video posted online by YouTube user Ratbag Nomad, one man, referred to as Australianwidefishingguide, shows tourists how it's done. Emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of Australia. As the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air, the mob of emus started coming closer. And closer. The video, filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush, shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance. Peddling his legs to the sky, he looks like something between  an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach. Sure enough, the Emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what's going on, then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat. A good leg in the air does the trick. As the guide leapt to his feet, the inquisitive birds scattered. It's thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu -\u00a0whose meat was highly valued for its oils. Emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary. Capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km\/hour, they're said to be able to 'run the pants off a Kangaroo.' The manoeuvre is thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - a bird whose meat was highly valued for its oils but who are too fast to catch on foot.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed. Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight. The findings come in the wake of a European court case\u00a0brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very \u2013 or morbidly \u2013 obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity \u2013 classified as a BMI of more than 40 \u2013 could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'.

More in-depth research took place in 2007 with archaeologists discovering clay tablets of human feet, faded coloured drawings on the plaster of the walls, giant gates and fragments of burnt wood.

The Oxford crew were training on the Thames for the\u00a0Boat Race which \u00a0takes place on Saturday, April 11. The RNLI revealed the conditions were caused by strong wind against the tide creating three successive waves that poured over the boat's riggers, 'creating an influx of water that could not be managed by the craft's bilge pump'. In a statement RNLI helmsman Ian Owen said: 'While we have rescued quite a number of rowers over the years, this is the first time I've been involved in helping such a prestigious team. 'The weather can be unpredictable on the Thames, and the Oxford University team dealt with the situation as safely and calmly as possible. We wish them all the best for their upcoming race.' Chiswick and Tower stations are the busiest in the country, and the RNLI has saved over 3,600 people since the service began in 2002. The RNLI Alternative Boat Race fundraising event on April 10 takes place the day before the BNY Mellon Boat Race on the same famous stretch of river.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Oklahoma introduced a law allowing it to use nitrogen gas to kill death row prisoners if lethal injections aren't available. Governor Mary Fallin signed into law a bill approving nitrogen as an alternative method of death, giving Oklahoma four different ways to enact its death penalty. The method, which involves pumping a chamber full of nitrogen and leaving a prisoner's body to die from lack of oxygen, has been touted as 'foolproof' by supporters, in the wake of the embarrassingly botched lethal injections. Scroll down for video. Gas chamber: The state of Oklahoma has legalized killing death row in-mates with nitrogen. This 1999 file photo shows an Arizona correctional officer explaining his state's execution method. Executions in the state are currently on hold while the Supreme Court ponders whether the three-drug mix now favored by Oklahoma is constitutional. The pause follows an infamous execution last ear, which saw officials struggle to administer a the poison to an inmate, who writhed on the gurney in pain for some 43 minutes before finally dying. Nitrogen - which has never been used to execute humans before - is now the state's second choice. The new bill, effective from November 2015, moves the electric chair back from second preference to third, while firing squad becomes a distant fourth choice if all other methods are unavailable. Proponents tout that nitrogen killings will be 'fast and painless' for inmates - and also say the method is 'foolproof' as it requires no medical expertise or complex procedures. In a statement issued as the bill was signed, Fallin, a Republican, said: 'Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous. 'I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard.' The bill authored by Republican Rep. Mike Christian and Republican Sen. Anthony Sykes had passed the state House on an 85-10 vote and cleared the Senate on a 41-0 vote. Christian, a former Highway Patrol trooper, said: 'The process is fast and painless - it's foolproof.' Opponents say there's no way to know whether the method is painless and effective. 'It just hasn't been tried, so we don't know,' said Rep. Emily Virgin, a Democrat from Norman who opposes the death penalty.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: A teenage Welsh international has had her promising career halted by a dead shin bone. Hannah Bluck, 18, from Porthcawl, south Wales, had her dreams shattered after a rare condition ruled her out of the game for two years. The teen football prodigy was warned by doctors that her leg could collapse into her ankle after being diagnosed with avascular necrosis in her distal tibia. Wales' Hannah Bluck, 18, \u00a0has had her promising career halted after suffering a rare condition. The 18-year-old has played for the Wales youth national teams at U19, U17 and U16 level. Avascular necrosis is bone death due to poor blood supply. The flow of blood to a section of bone can be interrupted if the bone is fractured or the joint becomes dislocated. The condition can lead to the eventual collapse of the bone. It is most common in people between the ages of 30 and 60, though most suffer from it in the hip and shoulder. The ultra-rare condition has caused her weight-bearing shin bone to die from lack of oxygen. Doctors have been baffled by the condition, which has never been seen before on a leg bone and usually affects joints. Mum Kerstin said: 'The doctor told her \"Hannah, you have to listen to everything I say because even if you go jogging then your leg could collapse into your ankle and that would be the worst thing that could ever happen\". 'I think she's dealt with it better than we have as parents. She's been so brave. 'She has such a high pain threshold and her first words to me after her accident were \"where've you been and what took you so long?\" 'Hannah's a girl of few words but one of the most aggressive centre-backs you'll ever see.' The youngster set records at youth level for Wales - appearing for the under-16s, under-17s and under-19s sides in the space of just eight days - before she was struck down by a freak accident in March 2013. The promising centre-back suffered a sickening dislocation of her ankle and fractured her fibia and tibia after falling while running on astroturf during routine training. Despite the help of Football Association of Wales and Cardiff City physios, the talented star hit a brick road in her recovery and saw specialists in November 2013 when she discovered she had AVN.

Shadow health secretary and keen football fan Andy Burnham said the move could unlock \u00a3400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars over the course of the next parliament. And he said Labour was ready to legislate if necessary to ensure elite clubs lived up to their 1999 promise to support struggling community facilities and projects.

Mr Burnham accused Prime Minister David Cameron of failing to get tough on the Premier League despite a massive increase in its TV revenues during his time in power. Although the league puts \u00a3168million into grassroots sport, this represents only a fraction of the \u00a35billion it has taken in from TV deals between 2013 and 2016, said Labour. Mr Burnham said: 'The last Labour government secured a commitment from the Premier League that five per cent of all TV income should be invested in the grassroots. 'Since then, TV rights have soared by over 160 per cent, but David Cameron has failed to make sure that the game's elite honours its obligations to the next generation coming through. David Cameron is accused of not keeping his promises and getting tough on the Premier League. 'Football at grassroots is struggling and, in many cities, Premier League stadia loom over run-down changing rooms and overgrown pitches. The gap between top and bottom in our national sport has never been wider. 'Premier League clubs only have permission to sell their rights collectively if they can demonstrate that it is in the wider public interest. That is why a Labour government will take action to ensure that every penny the Premier League owes is paid in full, unlocking an estimated \u00a3400 million for the grassroots in the next parliament.'

His appeal is expected to be heard by a separate FA panel next month and Oyston still faces a ban from football activities.

On Monday, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced charges of assault and mistreatment of a prisoner against William Melendez. He's the 49-year-old former Inkster, Michigan, police officer who is seen in police car dashcam video grabbing the unarmed motorist, Floyd Dent, around the neck while he lay on the ground and punching him several times in the head. \"The alleged police brutality in this case cannot and will not be tolerated,\" Worthy said. On Wednesday, drug charges against Dent, 57, were formally dropped in Michigan Circuit Court, clearing the motorist of all wrongdoing. \"He busted out crying and was very emotional,\" said Angela Martin, the assistant to Dent's attorney.

Marsh would not cite a specific reason for Yost's investigation, though she had been the face of the Police Department during the investigation into her former officer.

The system is still working, and we are very hopeful the prosecutor's net will catch even more fish in the near future.\" Yost did not respond to a request for comment. Dent, a veteran Ford automotive worker, was arrested after the January traffic stop on charges of drug possession, assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. With the court decision Wednesday, all charges from the arrest have been dropped.

But after doing some research Mrs Thomas was shocked to discover the condition can lead to facial disfigurement and even blindness.

Miles was referred to Sunderland Hospital in January 2015, where doctors carried out X-rays to rule out craniosynostosis, a more serious head condition that can cause headaches, learning difficulties and eye problems.

More than one million people have already booked their slots to see the piece of linen that devotees believe to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ between now and June 24. 'Whether you believe or don't believe, there is no doubt it is something special,' said an Italian man who was among the first visitors following the opening mass in the Italian city of Turin. Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia presents the Holy Shroud, which will be on public display until June 24, 2015. Pilgrims have already made reservations to see the cloth, believed to have been used to wrap Jesus' body. Imprinted with the image of a man who appears to have been crucified, the shroud has been dated to the end of the 13th century, lending support to those who say it is a medieval forgery. But it has retained its mystical air for many thanks partly to the fact that researchers have been unable to establish exactly how the image was created. The Church does not officially maintain that Christ's body was wrapped in the shroud or that any miracles were involved in the creation of the image now on display. But it does value the relic's symbolic value as a powerful representation of Christ's suffering. 'It is not a profession of faith because it is not an object of faith, nor of devotion, but it can help faith,' Turin Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia said earlier this week. Local authorities are counting on the exhibition of the shroud in the city's cathedral to give a significant boost to the local economy at a time of stagnation across Italy.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)Saudi Arabia has executed a second Indonesian maid despite protests from Jakarta, which is itself facing fierce criticism for its failure to heed calls for clemency for a number of foreigners on death row. The Indonesian government summoned the Saudi ambassador to the foreign ministry on Thursday after learning that 37-year-old Karni Bt. Medi Tarsim had been beheaded, without official warning. Karni was sentenced to death in March 2013 for killing her employer's four-year-old child. She was the second Indonesian domestic worker executed by the Saudis this week, following the death of Siti Zaenab Bt. Duhri Rupa on Tuesday -- the execution again carried out with Indonesian officials receiving no prior warning. \"That is our main issue. It's not that suddenly there was an execution. We didn't know when it would take place. Still, we took over a hundred steps to try to free (Siti) from execution,\" said Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Siti, 47, was convicted of killing her employer's wife in 1999, but the death penalty was delayed until the youngest of the victim's sons reached puberty and was old enough to consider requesting her pardon. He didn't. Rights groups say they suspect Siti was mentally ill and cast aspersions on claims she had confessed to the crime. Amnesty International also said reports suggested she had been abused while working in the victim's home. \"Imposing the death penalty and executing someone with a suspected mental illness smacks of a basic lack of humanity,\" said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Programme Director at Amnesty International. In a statement, the Indonesian government said the protection of its citizens abroad was a \"priority\" and listed the attempts it had made to help Siti, including providing legal aid, writing letters to the Saudi King and \"continuous efforts... to ask for forgiveness from the family.\" Indonesia said in many cases its efforts had worked. From July 2011 to the end of March this year, it said it had \"successfully freed\" 238 of its citizens from the death penalty. One of those was Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad who was sentenced to death in 2011 after reportedly admitting to killing her 70-year-old employer and stealing $10,000. Satinah claimed she acted in self-dense. Days before her scheduled execution, the Indonesian government stepped in with so-called \"blood money\" of 7 million Saudi riyals --\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Emma Hannigan was told in 2005 that she carried the faulty BRCA1 gene, which increases a woman's chance of getting breast cancer by 85 per cent, and ovarian cancer by 50 per cent.

The figures were nearly double the same period a year earlier, while the amount of narcotics seized was up by 44.9%, according to the ministry. Liu said drug trafficking groups have \"suffered a heavy blow\" and drug users have been \"forcefully regulated.\" However, the police also paid a price, Liu said, in quotes carried by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Nine police officers died and another 657 were wounded in the mission, with 76 severely wounded. The ministry rewarded 60 units and 100 people. Liu said China's drug-related problems were still severe, with online drug trafficking an increasing problem. He said the ministry had launched a three-month online campaign starting in April targeting people engaged in drug-related Internet crimes. Over the past nine months, a string of movie and television stars, film directors and pop singers have been arrested and charged over drug related incidents, including Jaycee Chan, son of kung fu movie star Jackie Chan, who was convicted on a drug charge and sentenced to six months in prison by a Beijing court.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today. Tehran and Riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the Middle East. In its most recent incarnation, the Iranian-Saudi conflict by proxy has reached Yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic. For Riyadh and its regional allies, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen -- \"Operation Decisive Storm\" -- is the moment the Sunni Arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of Shia-Iranian influence. For Tehran and its regional allies -- including the Houthi movement in Yemen -- Saudi Arabia's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable. And yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the Yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war. When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June 2013, he pledged to reach out to Riyadh. He was up front and called Tehran's steep deterioration of relations with the Saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on Iranian foreign policy. From Lebanon and Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Gaza Strip, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly. And yet despite Rouhani's open pledge, profound differences over Syria and Iraq in particular have kept Riyadh and Tehran apart. But if the questions of Syria and Iraq prevented a pause in hostilities, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels. Unlike in Syria and in Iraq, the Saudi military is now directly battling it out with Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. While Riyadh no doubt exaggerates Tehran's role in the Yemen crisis, its fingerprints are nonetheless evident. \"Iran provides financial support, weapons, training and intelligence to Houthis,\" Gerald Feierstein, a U.S. State Department official and former Yemen ambassador, told a Congressional hearing last week. \"We believe that Iran sees opportunities with the Houthis to expand its influence in Yemen and threaten Saudi and Gulf Arab interests.\" The Iranians find the charges biased and point to the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor's affairs. In Iran, the cue came from the country's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been unusually blunt. He tweeted: \"Despite disputes, the Saudis used to display composure [with] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power &\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising.

But attempts to cash in on this elite status by launching a brand of fashion and polo-related goods have been scuppered by the European Court after objections fromthe Beverly Hills Polo Club. Prince Charles, right and Actress Stefanie Powers are among those to have frequented the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club since it was founded in 1982. Charles was the first member of the club. Bill Wyman, bass guitarist for The Rolling Stones at the club with a friend in 1987. The ruling will be all the more frustrating for bosses at the Berkshire club, given that its rival isn't even a real polo club and openly admits to using the sport to create the perception of eliteness. The Berkshire club had applied to register its polo player logo on four classes of item including glasses, watches, jewellery and leather goods including travel bags, whips, harnesses and saddlery. But it was opposed by the Beverly Hills brand on the grounds that people could confuse the logo with their own and the case was eventually taken to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. While it allowed the logo on whips, harnesses and saddlery, which discerning customers were unlikely to get confused, it ruled against the Berkshire club on applications for the other items. It said: 'It is true that the polo player is facing left and holding his mallet upright, while the earlier marks the polo player is facing right and holding his mallet ready to strike the ball. 'However, those slight differences are not sufficient enough to reduce significantly the similarity deriving from the fact that both the signs at issue display the figure of a polo player astride a galloping horse,' The Times reports. In 2006, the club was also blocked from using its logo on perfume and soap after a challenge from Ralph Lauren, famous for its Polo brand, also featuring a polo player, swinging a mallet. Too similar: Logo for the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club.

A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet. Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above. She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training.

He was arrested for possession of cocaine at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand (above) Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: No blame: Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes. Divorce laws in England and Wales should remove the need for allegations of adultery and blame, Britain\u2019s most senior female judge has said. Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce. Divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons: adultery; unreasonable behaviour; desertion for two or more years; two years\u2019 separation with consent; or five years\u2019 separation without consent. The second reason \u2013 unreasonable behaviour\u2019 \u2013 is by far the most widely used. Around 120,000 couples divorce in England and Wales each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour, which, critics argue, encourages recriminations. Lady Hale, who is deputy president to the Supreme Court and the only woman among the 12 Supreme Court justices, also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before obtaining a divorce as part of the overhaul. She told The Times: \u2018We should make it take longer to get a divorce and encourage people to sort out what happens to the home, children, money before, rather than after, they get a divorce.\u2019 Couples would have a one-year \u2018cooling off period\u2019 after declaring that their marriage had permanently broken down in order for them to sort out arrangements. Lady Hale, 70, was behind the move for \u2018no fault\u2019 divorce in England and Wales 20 years ago. Conservative MPs saw off the proposals and said that removing fault would take away responsibility and undermine the concept of marriage. Last night campaigners and lawyers backed the proposed overhaul. Resolution: Lady Hale also wants arrangements for children and money resolved before divorce is finalised. Sir Paul Coleridge, former family High Court judge and chairman of the Marriage Foundation, told The Times: \u2018Lady Hale, a complete expert with decades of experience across this whole field, is entirely right. \u2018Our current system which pretends to be fault-based is in practice and reality no such thing.

With two hooves sticking out for several minutes in the midst of labor? Luckily, Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ. In an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet, Katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby (about 6 feet tall) early Friday evening. There was no immediate word on the newborn's gender or condition. But there were good signs, as seen on the live stream and Dallas Zoo's Twitter feed -- like its ears moving, its efforts to stand, and its nursing (or at least trying to nurse) from mom. \"We're so proud,\" the zoo tweeted. The newcomer's debut was a long time coming, especially when you count for Katie's 15-month gestation period -- average for a giraffe, according to Animal Planet. The baby joins a sister, 4-year-old calf Jamie. It wasn't immediately known how many people online saw Katie go into labor and give birth. But the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn, one of them being Katie's BFF Jade. The fact that the spunky Katie held up so well under the spotlight isn't a total shocker.  The zoo describes her as the \"diva\" among a herd of 12 giraffes at the zoo who loves to \"toss her head around\" when she doesn't like something.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: PC Ronnie Lungu has won a race discrimination case against Wiltshire Police. A black police constable has won a race discrimination case against his force after they did not promote him due to the colour of his skin. Ronnie Lungu was singled out as 'a marked man' by Wiltshire Police solely due to his race, the employment tribunal ruled. It found the 40-year-old was passed over for promotion in favour of white colleagues after his internal assessments were secretly downgraded to make him appear unworthy. It also heard evidence that derogatory comments were made about Mr Lungu based on his colour violating his dignity. When the PC raised concerns with his superiors they were not taken seriously and his complaints were brushed off as trivial. The force - which has only 16 ethnic minority officers out of a total of just over 1,000 - had denied the claims. But the tribunal ruled that the Zimbabwe-born officer was unlawfully discriminated against on grounds of race. Mr Lungu said: 'When I realised I was being singled out and treated badly because of the colour of my skin I felt so angry and upset. 'I had worked all my career to serve the community and be the best police officer I could but I was being penalised because I was black. 'It was totally unacceptable. But what made matters worse was that when I did raise the issue internally it wasn't taken seriously.' The tribunal in Bristol was told that the father-of-three joined the force as a police constable in 2003 after moving to England and 10 years later was temporarily promoted to the role of sergeant. After passing his sergeant's exam he applied for the role permanently, but he was turned down. Employment judges were told he was the only black candidate out of 20 officers to go for the position. The panel found that his internal assessments were specifically downgraded in order to make him appear unworthy of promotion. It also was told that a senior member of staff were invited to make negative comments about PC Lungu during an appraisal. The tribunal concluded that Wiltshire Police had singled out Mr Lungu as a'marked man' on grounds of his race. The judgment read: 'The reduction in the scoring has the very significant effect in terms of making it appear reasonable that the one black applicant for promotion was scoring lower than the 19 white applicants and should therefore not be promoted.' It went on: 'This behaviour is so extreme that the Tribunal cannot think of any apparent motive other than one that is directly related to [the] Claimant's race.'

Peachtree City Police Chief William McCollom called 911 early New Year's Day to report inadvertently shooting his ex-wife, Margaret, as they slept in their suburban Atlanta home. The shooting left Margaret McCollom paralyzed below the waist. McCollom resigned from the chief's job in March. Peachtree City Chief of Police William McCollom, pictured left, dialed 911 to report accidentally shooting his wife Margaret, right, as she slept in their suburban Atlanta home early New Year's Day. Griffin Judicial Circuit District Attorney Scott Ballard said investigators found no evidence McCollom intended to harm Margaret McCollom.\u00a0However, Ballard said he concluded the shooting could have been prevented. The prosecutor said McCollom told investigators he drank alcohol and took medication to help him sleep. Ballard said the investigation showed that McCollom, a former firearms instructor, woke during the night when he heard barking dogs, prompting him to grab his service handgun from a dresser and search the house. He returned to bed with the gun and told investigators he woke next to the sound of a gunshot, Ballard said. The chief said he suspected he might have been trying in his sleep to move the gun to a nightstand. 'The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, and I put it to a side and it went off,' McCollom told a 911 dispatcher, according to a recording of the call. McCollom worked in policing for nearly 30 years in Wyoming, Florida and Georgia. He resigned from the police chief position in Georgia in March. Investigators found no evidence that McCollom was trying to hurt Margaret. He was indicted on Wednesday on a misdemeanor reckless-conduct charge. Margaret McCollom told police at the hospital that she was asleep when the shooting happened but believed it was an accident, according to state investigators. The couple divorced in 1999 but later reunited. 'When I look at the facts, it appears to me that this is reckless conduct,' Ballard said. If convicted, McCollom could face a year in jail. McCollom's defense attorney, Thomas Cook Jr., did not respond to a message seeking comment. McCollom worked in policing for nearly 30 years in Wyoming, Florida and Georgia.

He has watched dying drag on for weeks or months as terrified relatives stand by helplessly. Recently, however, his thoughts about how seriously ill people die have become personal. Swangard was diagnosed in 2013 with a rare form of metastatic cancer. To remove the cancer, surgeons took out parts of his pancreas and liver, as well as his entire spleen and gallbladder. The operation was successful but Swangard, 48, knows there's a strong chance the disease will return. And if he gets to a point where there's nothing more medicine can do, he wants to be able to control when and how his life ends. \"It's very real for me,\" said Swangard, who lives in Bolinas, Calif. \"This could be my own issue a year from now.\" That's one of the reasons Swangard joined a California lawsuit last month seeking to let doctors prescribe lethal medications to certain patients who want to hasten death. If he were given only months to live, Swangard said, he can't say for certain whether he would take them. \"But I want to be able to make that choice,\" he said. The right-to-die movement has gained renewed momentum in California and around the nation following the highly publicized death of an East Bay woman with brain cancer. Brittany Maynard, 29, moved to Oregon to take advantage of its \"Death with Dignity\" law and died in November after taking a fatal dose of barbiturates prescribed by her doctor. The California lawsuit asks the court to protect physicians from liability if they prescribe lethal medications to patients who are both terminally ill and mentally competent to decide their fate. The lawsuit argues that while it is against the law in California for anyone to assist in another's suicide, these cases are not suicides. Rather, the suit argues, they are choices by a dying person on how his or her life should end and decisions about one's own body protected under the state constitution. Separately, two California state senators have proposed a bill that would allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication to certain terminally ill adults. Three states -- Oregon, Washington and Vermont -- already have laws allowing physician-assisted deaths.

Adebayor will enter the final 12 months of his deal this summer and will be made available for loan or a permanent move. A loan switch may suit the former Arsenal man knowing he could net a lucrative free transfer at the end of his Spurs deal in 2016. The 31-year-old Togolese forward has made just nine league starts this season for Spurs. Adebayor is on the peripheries of Pochettino's first-team plans and is unlikely to push himself to the forefront of the Argentine's blueprint any time soon. The form of Harry Kane, coupled with off the field problems, has seen the striker make just nine league starts this season. Despite his problems on-the-pitch, the 31-year-old seems content with life off it as he took to Instagram on Wednesday afternoon. Accompanied with the caption: 'SEA, my African roots made me what I am today. They are the reason I'am here today. I owe the continent a lot. It felt amazing to be back home,' the forward posted via the social media network a picture head-to-toe in African clothing stating his pride in his heritage.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Melissa Borg left her Baulkham Hills home in north-west Sydney at 7:30am on Thursday in her school uniform and made her way to The Hills Sports High School in Seven Hills. However, the Year 9 student never made it to class and after her father found no sign of her when he searched their house following work, he reported his daughter missing to police. 13-year-old Melissa Borg (pictured) has been missing from her Baulkham Hills home since last Thursday. Castle Hill Police have been assisting Melissa's family with the investigation into her disappearance ever since. Melissa is described by police as being 150cm with a slim build, long brown hair and brown eyes and was last seen wearing her school uniform - a dark blue skirt and a pale blue blouse. Police have questioned her school friends about her mysterious disappearance, however they have so far been unable to find the child. Melissa's parents are extremely concerned at her out of character actions and are worried about her young age. The teenager left home at 7:30AM and made her way to The Hills Sports High School in Seven Hills. Speaking to news.com.au Inspector David Hogg said  police were holding out hope that Melissa was with friends. 'With any 13-year-old that goes missing for this time frame it's serious but our hope is she's with some friends and just doesn't want to contact her family,' Inspector Hogg said. 'If that is the case, whatever issue she has, we'd hope that she'd at least get in contact with police so we can get in contact with her family and let them know she is okay.' Inspector Hogg told the publication that there were unconfirmed sightings of the 13-year-old in the Merrylands area. However Melissa never made it to class and her father alerted police to her disappearance when he arrived home from work and she was nowhere to be found. Melissa's family and friends have taken to their Facebook pages to share a photo of the teenager in her school uniform. A picture posted online by Melissa's aunt Tricia Carlow has already been shared over 2,000 times around the Sydney area. 'My niece Melissa Borg is missing from the Baulkham Hills area since Thursday afternoon 02nd April 2015,' the caption said. 'Can you please share this around and keep an eye out for her.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Atlanta  (CNN)Silently moving deep beneath the ocean's surface, combat submarines can employ the element of surprise to carry out devastating attacks on naval fleets and land targets. For decades, the U.S. military has maintained its dominance in the depths of the world's oceans by boasting the most technologically advanced submarine fleet. However, officials say China and other nations are rapidly expanding the size and scope of their own submarine forces. And, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, the U.S. must rethink the role of manned submarines and prioritize new underwater detection techniques. \"We know they are out experimenting and looking at operating, and clearly want to be in this world of advanced submarines,\" Vice Adm. Joseph Mulloy told the House Armed Services Committee's sea power subcommittee in February. Mulloy, who is deputy chief of naval operations for capabilities and resources, says Chinese submarines are still technologically inferior to those used by the United States, but that margin of difference is shrinking. Concern that China could match U.S. underwater capabilities in the near future has encouraged the development of an unmanned drone ship to independently track enemy ultra-quiet diesel electric submarines over thousands of miles to limit their tactical capacity for surprise. Initiated by a Pentagon research group called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Vessel (ACTUV) would be able to operate under with little supervisory control but also as remotely controlled or piloted vessels, depending on the circumstances of specific missions. \"We're looking for test-ready, multi-sensor approaches that push the boundaries of today's automated sensing systems for unmanned surface vessels,\" said Scott Littlefield, DARPA program manager. \"Enhancing the ability of these kinds of vessels to sense their environment in all weather and traffic conditions, day or night, would significantly advance our ability to conduct a range of military missions.\" DARPA says the so-called drone ships will be 132 feet long and likely cost about $20 million, significantly less than the billion-dollar manned warships currently in use. The development of the ACTUV aligns with the \"culture change\" described by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus Tuesday at the Navy League's Sea Air Space symposium at National Harbor, Maryland. \"Unmanned systems, particularly autonomous ones, have to be the new normal in ever-increasing areas,\" Maybus said. Maybus said new staff will be put into place to help streamline, coordinate and champion unmanned systems in \"all domains\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: The U.S. put the first man on the moon, but in a strange twist of history it appears the Russians may have beat America in settling Oregon. Experts proposed this new theory in a recently released 200-page report on the Molalla Log Cabin, a structure they believe could have been built as early as 1795 - ten years before Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean. Historic building repairer Gregg Olson and architectural historian Pam Hayden have been analyzing the log cabin for seven years and say it is unlike anything else found in Oregon. Secrets hidden in wood: Experts believe the Molalla Log House (above) was constructed as early as 1795 - a decade before Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean. One of a kind: The construction of the log cabin is unlike pioneer building methods at the time - suggesting it was instead made by foreigners. Russians in America: Historic building repairer Gregg Olson and architectural historian Pam Hayden believe the house could have been used by a small settlement of Russians sent to the Willamette Valley as farmers to feed fur traders in Alaska. Passion project: Gregg Olson (pictured), of Historic Building Repair, has spend seven years working on the Molalla Log Cabin. The cabin's intricate construction is not consistent with pioneer building methods, suggesting it was created by foreigners, and more specifically Russians. The way the logs are tightly interwoven, secured without nails and leaving no gaps to fill, is similar to Russian log cabins of the same time period, when Catherine the Great was sending envoys to Alaska to boost the fur trade. Olson and Hayden hypothesize that the 18-foot-wide cabin could have been a home for a small group of 10 to 50 Russian settlers sent to Oregon's Willamette Valley as farmers to feed the fur trappers on Alaska's Kodiak Island. Looking for a home: Above, a view of the cabin before its roof collapsed and it was moved indoors in 2008. Olson and Hayden are currently trying to find a permanent place to house the cabin. The first mobile home: Olson discovered that the original builders of the cabin wrote numbers into the boards, so that the structure could be disassembled and reassembled. Expert craftsmanship: The boards fit perfectly together so that nothing is needed to fill in the gaps and winterize the structure for winter. Many uses: Throughout its storied life, the Molalla Log Cabin has been used as a home, animal shelter, machine shed and granary.

Heidi Bretscher's troubles began around mile 17 of the Rock N' Roll Raleigh Marathon that took place earlier this month. The 28-year-old runner was so far ahead of the pack it wasn't clear to her which way she was meant to go. Wrong way: Heidi Bretscher, 28, said she was on pace to beat her personal record when she, and the two cyclists who were accompanying her, missed an unmarked turn. Retracing her steps: At mile 19, Bretscher was leading the women's race by about 30 minutes. She found a police officer who gave her a ride back to mile 17. Somehow, she ended up running entirely off the planned route and around a lake that wasn't even on the course. Despite her unscheduled detour, Ms. Bretscher's was brought back on track by a couple of helpful cops who drove her in their patrol cars back to the point in the race where things became muddled. After working out her timings and distances she still managed to cross the line well ahead of her closest rival. 'I'm a little frustrated,' she told ABC 11 following her victory.

This has been a whirlwind season for the 19-year-old, with his exceptional performances for MK Dons earning a \u00a35million move to White Hart Lane in February. Alli has yet to feature for Spurs having been immediately loaned back to his boyhood club, where he has continued to impress - so much so that on Sunday he was crowned the Football League Young Player of the Year. MK Dons teenager Dele Alli picked up the Young Player of the Year award on Sunday night. The midfielder was quick to credit MK Dons upon picking up the award and is determined to repay their faith by helping them secure promotion to the Championship. 'MK has got a special place in my heart but obviously I have signed to Tottenham,' Alli said. 'Whilst I am at MK, I am just going to be focused on them, right until the end of the season. 'To get promotion would be the perfect ending to a fairytale, really. 'Obviously, being from MK and playing for MK my whole life, to get us promoted would be a dream come true.' The talented midfielder's performances led to Tottenham signing him for \u00a35million in January transfer window. The Dons sit third in League One and have three matches to make up the one-point gap Preston hold in the final automatic promotion spot. Alli has been key to Karl Robinson's side, scoring 16 goals in 41 appearances, but admits it has not always been easy to concentrate as the speculation mounted. 'I am not going to lie and say it hasn't been hard because it has,' he said. 'For a few years now there have been rumours of me going places. I've been speaking to my agent to see what it is all about. 'Obviously the last year really it has picked up a bit and there has been a lot more speculation about me going other places.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: For most of us the thought of eating insects might prove to be one culinary step too far. But the consumption of locusts, crickets, worms and grubs could become very much a part of our diet as the cost of meat production rises, and the demand for meat grows. In tonight's final episode of BBC Two's Back In Time For Dinner, the Robshaws \u2013 Brandon, 53, Rochelle, 52, and their children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15 and Fred \u2013 who have travelled from the 1950s to the end of the millennium are served the food of the future. The Robshaws sample insects in tonight's episode of\u00a0BBC Two's Back for Dinner. Two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with insects. The experiment, filmed for a six-part TV programme, ended with the family feeling extremely grateful for the variety of foods available today. Presenter Giles Coren and food historian Polly Russell serve the family a radical dinner of Mexican spiced cricket tacos, Asian worm stir fry, buffalo worm tart and cricket kebabs. The family also attempt burgers made with a mixture of insect and beef protein, and sample cookies made from insect flour. 'In the future meat supplies might be a problem,' presenter Mr Coren says in the programme. 'Insects have been hailed as a solution to our meat problem; full of protein, low in fat and packed full of nutrients they are already part of the staple diet in parts of Africa and Asia.' The lack of traditional meat proteins can be put down to population expansion, food historian Polly Russell explains. 'As populations grow globally there is a huge pressure on the amount of meat that is produced because as developing countries start getting richer and people start adopting Western-style diets, which tend to consume a lot more meat,' she said. Entomophagy (eating insects) could have a positive impact on the environment and world hunger if crunchy exoskeletons could replace typical meat. Throughout the show, in the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner, knowing his leftovers would be their supper.

Student Drew Hollinshead, 21, stopped in the first space available when he saw the pensioner collapse on the pavement. But as he helped her for less than a minute, a traffic warden put a \u00a370 ticket on his car \u2013 because Mr Hollinshead had pulled into a bay for disabled drivers. 'It's ridiculous': When he was slapped with the ticket on his windscreen Mr Hollinshead initially tore it up and threw it in the bin before later going back to pick it up. Yesterday Mr Hollinshead said the way he had been treated was ridiculous and said the council warden could see what was happening. He was driving through Bournemouth when he saw the woman fall to the pavement. He parked and rushed over to help. After discovering she was all right and helping her to her feet, he returned to the car only to find the warden printing the ticket. \u2018I stopped in the disabled bay as it was the nearest place to where the old lady was,\u2019 he said. Angry: Mr Hollinshead, who is studying marketing and advertising at Bournemouth University, said he was punished for trying to do something good. \u2018There was a space for about four cars and it was completely empty, so it wasn\u2019t like somebody was waiting to use it.

Second-placed Real, who hammered Granada 9-1 on Sunday with Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo netting his first five-goal haul, are four points behind Barca, who host Almeria earlier on Wednesday, with nine games left. Barring last-minute injuries, Ancelotti will have both Isco and James Rodriguez available for the first time in two months since James broke a bone in his foot and must decide which of the two playmakers joins Toni Kroos and Luka Modric across the centre. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti faces a selection dilemma ahead of Wednesday's match with Rayo. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 rout of Granada on Sunday. Ronaldo's five-star performance is hailed in the Monday edition of the Spanish sports daily AS. 'The man in the bag' ran the headline on the front cover of Monday's edition of Marca. Real Madrid are four points behind Barcelona in the race for the La Liga title. Isco, a Spain international who was suspended for the Granada game, performed well first during Modric's lengthy injury lay-off and then during the absence of James and has become a huge favourite with the Real fans. Ancelotti, by contrast, has been whistled by some sections of the Bernabeu crowd as Real stumbled since the turn of the year and if he drops Isco and the team stutter again the Italian could be in for a torrid time. James returned to action against Granada and Ancelotti praised him after the game, suggesting he favours the Colombian, who joined from Monaco for a fee of \u00a363m in the close season. James Rodriguez returned to the Real Madrid team during the match with Granada after two months out. Isco (left), seen here with Luka Modric in training last week, is also set to return to action soon. 'He played very well, it didn't look as though he hadn't played for two months,' Ancelotti said.

Several properties were littered with debris that appeared to fall out of the sky over the town of West Pittston in Luzerne County on Monday morning. Residents believe the rubbish came from the lavatory holding tank of a plane flying overhead, and have complained to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Paula Viccica believes the debris that landed on her property was expelled from a plane flying overhead. The bulk of the debris landed in the well-kept front garden and trees at the home of Paula Viccica. She told the Wilkes-Barre\/Scranton Times Leader that she saw pieces of white paper fluttering down from the sky for several minutes. She told the newspaper that local airport officials identified four planes flying overhead around the time she made the discovery. While no human waste was discovered, her 13-year-old daughter, Tori, said there was an odour to the debris after it landed in the garden. The homeowner complained to aviation authorities and wants assurance that it does not pose a danger. Paula told the Times Leader: \u2018Beyond aesthetics, I\u2019m concerned with safety. I want our property to be cleaned up and assurance that it does not pose a danger to anyone.\u2019 Other residents in the neighbourhood, about 115 miles north of Philadelphia, were surprised to learn about the discovery.

Her flight was bound for Newark, New Jersey, the major airport most convenient to her spacious Chappaqua, New York home. A reporter with the liberal news outlet Vox tweeted a photo of Clinton toting her own luggage on Thursday in Omaha. SHE'S JUST LIKE US? A Town Car sedan (right) met Mrs. Clinton on the tarmac in Newark on Thursday, flanked by police and Secret Service vehicles. Hillary Clinton took the fast route home from Iowa to the East Coast: just a 3-hour flight instead of 20 hours of driving time. Clinton had just finished a three-day presidential campaign swing in Council Bluffs, Iowa. That's just a few miles away, and home to a cafe where she held a top-secret meeting with Democratic Party insiders who were told to surrender their cell phones and cameras beforehand. In contrast with the private jet service Hillary has been accustomed to on her storied and lucrative speaking tours, her ride home was a no-frills commercial flight without a First Class seat to be found anywhere. For flights from Omaha to Newark, United uses Embraer ERJ-135 and ERJ-145 jets with nothing but narrow economy-class seats. END OF AN ERA? Scooby's first trip ended with a total of 10 confirmed sightings and more than 1,300 miles driven. Clinton flew back East on an EMbraer ERJ-series plane like this one.

But her first Iowa event, promoted as a spontaneous coffee shop sit-down with average voters, turned out to be a carefully staged production whose young participants were driven to the cafe by Clinton's Iowa political director. At least three of the 'everyday Americans' featured in Hillary's campaign launch video have ties to Democratic Party politics. And hours before her flight, Secret Service agents parked the now-familiar 'Scooby' van in a handicapped spot so she would have a shorter walk.

'We maintain our philosophy of letting the drivers race, but they both know the No 1 priority for the team is to win for Mercedes-Benz.'

The former Motherwell manager admitted being wowed by Murray Park in the days after he replaced Kenny McDowall. The club's \u00a312million training facility is a major improvement on the public pitches at Dalziel Park he was forced to make do with during his Steelmen stint. Stuart McCall insists he's loving life at Rangers despite losing heavily to Queen of the South. But along with the plush surroundings, McCall knows being manager of the Glasgow giants means he also has to cope with the kind of intense scrutiny levels he did not have to deal with at Fir Park. Not everyone is cut out for the strains of the job, as McDowall proved when he quit after posting just three wins from his 10-game spell as caretaker. The former Celtic youth coach found himself in charge just as the battle for power at Ibrox reached its bitterest point and at one stage admitted life at Rangers had 'taken its toll' on him. McCall has taken over a brighter picture following Dave King's boardroom victory and the 50-year-old former Light Blues midfielder seemed to shrug off the extra pressure during his first few weeks in charge as he led his side to three successive wins - including successes against Hearts and Hibs. Lewis Kidd (left) battles for the ball against Rangers' David Templeton in Queen of the South's victory. But the focus will have sharpened since Gers suffered their first defeat under his watch when they lost 3-0 to Queen of the South on Thursday. The Ibrox men will hope to shake that off come Sunday when they host Raith Rovers but McCall insists he will not let the job wear him down. He said: 'I've not really noticed a difference in intensity levels. I just love what I do out there on the training field. 'At this moment in time I don't feel any pressure whatsoever. Ian Black (left) and Kris Boyd in training as Rangers look to get back to winning ways and gain promotion.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: A robot has been 'arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets. The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed.

But one man, despite the odds against him, crossed the finish line. Venezuelan native Maickel Melamed, who is battling muscular dystrophy, completed the 26.2 miles just before 5 a.m. Tuesday. A group of energized fans rallied for the 39-year-old as he walked down Boylston Street in the pouring rain with volunteers from his foundation, Vamos. He was the last participant to complete the race, CNN affiliate WCVB-TV reported. Friends who were waiting for Melamed to cross the finish line said the university professor and motivational speaker is dedicated and motivated. \"He wants to show that life is great, no matter how many problems you can have,\" friend Perla Sananes said. Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking. Melamed has completed marathons in Chicago, New York, Berlin and Tokyo. Boston has a special place in his heart because his parents brought him to the city as a baby, WCVB-TV said. His perseverance was celebrated by crowds at the marathon finish line Tuesday morning, and also by fans online. Melamed is one of about 30,000 participants who raced in this year's marathon, which comes less than two weeks after a jury found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 charges related to the 2013 Boston bombings.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: With 20 goals to his name this season, Watford captain Troy Deeney is regarded by many as the best striker outside the Premier League. In fact, Deeney has been lighting up the Championship for the last three seasons, scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game. The next logical step for the Birmingham-born striker is the top flight and, with Watford just a point off the top of the table with five games to go, he could well be skippering the Hornets in the Premier League next season. Watford striker Troy Deeney won the Championship's Player of the Month award for March. Hornets skipper Deeney is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading Watford to the Premier League. Deeney believes he can follow in the path of Charlie Austin and Danny Ings  by becoming a Premier League hit. Watford are currently just one point behind Championship leaders Bournemouth with five games left to play. And Deeney, who was this week named the Sky Bet Championship player of the month for March, makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level. He said: 'I've looked at Charlie Austin, Danny Ings, Rickie Lambert and Grant Holt before that. 'These are all people that have been in the Championship, done well, then held their own in the Premier League. 'There is a sign there that you can really go on (from the Championship). If you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals. 'I want to make sure that when I go up there I'm ready for it and I show what I'm about.' It seems fair for Deeney to say 'when' and not 'if' he plays at the top level because on this season's evidence he and striker partner Odion Ighalo certainly are ready for it. Between them the Championship's most lethal strikeforce have scored 39 league goals this season and Deeney waxed lyrical about his Nigerian strike partner. 'He's a natural finisher,' he said. 'Before Saturday (when Ighalo scored from 20 yards in the win over Middlesbrough) we had been joking that all of his goals were inside the 18-yard box. 'He's definitely a poacher and when he scores he normally scores doubles, one game he got four. He scores in bunches which is a sign of a real good striker.'

The Daily Mirror published sensational pictures of the Hatton Garden raiders 21 hours before Scotland Yard released them in a bid to appeal for information about identities of the thieves. The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted', according to a report today in its sister title The Sunday Mirror, with an apparent source saying it 'blows the case wide open'. But yesterday afternoon detectives insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Pictured: The Met has released images of three of the gang which broke into Hatton Garden over the Easter weekend - but has only done so after the shots were revealed by the Daily Mirror. Audacious: Exactly why the police did not release the images beforehand is unclear - especially as the tabloid's sister paper The Sunday Mirror claims they are the key to 'cracking the case wide open' This is in stark contrast with the response given to MailOnline hours before, when police refused to say whether they had the footage. The Met finally released the pictures late on Saturday afternoon, while The Mirror could sell the images to a number of other national titles, including this website. Up until that point, no other newspaper was able to help the police trace the culprits of what could be the biggest ever robbery in Britain. It raises questions about why the police chose to keep them to themselves - or whether they even had the footage. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme this morning, former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said: 'I've never heard of anything like this. 'I'm not blaming The Mirror, but I am pointing some quite accusing fingers at the police for not finding it themselves.'

Owners of the security deposit boxes are continuing to demand answers on why police failed to respond to the alarm when it first went off over the long weekend.

Identified: The police chief for the eastern Nangarhar province identified the Afghan shooter as Abdul Azim from the Lagham province. It was the second fatality suffered by NATO since the beginning of the year, when the coalition launched its new mission in Afghanistan called Resolute Support.\u00a0Also, an Afghan soldier killed three American contractors on January 29. The shooter was also killed in that incident. General Fazel Ahmad Sherzad, who is police chief for eastern Nangarhar province where the shooting happened, said it took place immediately after the meeting and the embassy official has left. 'Right after the U.S. official had left, suddenly an Afghan army soldier opened fire on the U.S. soldiers who were present in the compound,' Sherzad told The Associated Press. The American troops returned fire, killing the Afghan soldier, whom Sherzad identified as Abdul Azim, from Laghman province. The motive for his attack was not immediately known. Information was sketchy and an eyewitness told the AP that four U.S. troops had been wounded in the attack - not three as Sherzad said - and were being treated at a clinic on the American base in Jalalabad. Surprise attack: Afghan policemen console each other at the site of the deadly attack by an Afghan national army soldier who opened fire on U.S. troops, in the compound of the provincial governor, Jalalabad, Afghanistan on Wednesday.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Kalashnikov, 52, had knowledge of the 'Anti-Maidan' movement,. which opposed pro-Western protests that ousted Yanukovich, suggesting this might be a motive for his alleged murder.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: An Arkansas woman became a little richer this week after finding a large diamond at Crater of Diamonds State Park. Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, found the 3.69-carat white diamond in a 37.5-acre search field on Thursday, her last day of a trip to the park with her husband. Clark, who first visited the park 33 years ago with her mother and grandmother, prayed to God, asking, 'Are you doing to bless me and let me find a diamond today?' as she searched the field. Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, Arkansas, found a 3.69-carat white diamond on a search field at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas. Clark named the pinto-bean-sized, teardrop-shaped gem a 'hallelujah diamond' because she spotted the gem shortly after praying that she would find something. And shortly after praying, Clark said she spotted the diamond sticking out of a ridge of plowed dirt, according to Region 8. She named the teardrop-shaped diamond the Hallelujah Diamond, claiming that her prayer helped her find the gem. Clark plans to keep the pinto-sized diamond, which is the largest diamond of the 122 found in the park this year. Crater of Diamonds State Park holds the only diamond-bearing site accessible to the public, in the form of a large plowed search field. 'The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent metallic shine,' park interpreter Waymon Cox told Region 8. 'It's the largest one found since April 16, 2014.' The search field had just been plowed earlier in the week because the park had seen a lot of rain, Cox said. 'This regular endeavor loosens the diamond-bearing soil which, along with rain erosion, brings more diamonds to the surface and helps park visitors' chances of finding them,' he said. Cox added: 'With all the rain we've been seeing, along with this week's plowing, there's a good chance more diamonds will be found on the surface in the days to come.' Crater of Diamonds State Park has the only\u00a0diamond-bearing site accessible to the public in the U.S. Clark's diamond was the largest of the 122 found this year on the 37.5-acre search field.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Police said witnesses told them that around midnight on Saturday three gunmen stormed the dark and gritty site where Corinthians' fan group Pavilhao 9 meets underneath a highway overpass. They ordered the victims to lie face down on the ground and shot seven in the head. An eighth man was shot but tried to escape, reached a gas station and was later taken to a nearby hospital where he died. Armed police stand guard outside the headquarters of Corinthians fan club\u00a0Pavilhao 9 on Sunday morning. A distraught woman talks on her mobile phone outside the building where seven men were executed. A policeman shows the bullet shells that were collected at the scene of the shooting west of Sao Paulo. Detective Arlindo Jose Negrao ruled out a fight between rival fan groups. He would not reveal the motive behind the attack, however, saying that could interfere with the probe. 'Through witnesses, we are already exploring a line of investigation, which is not leading us to believe it was caused by fan rivalry,' Negrao said at a press conference. 'We even have possible suspects.' The victims were having a barbecue at the club at the time and making flags with their team's colours for Sunday's anticipated match between Corinthians and Palmeiras. The fan group did not answer several phone calls. Pavilhao 9 was founded by a group of Corinthians fans who played football with inmates at Brazil's Carandiru prison, known widely for a massacre that left 111 inmates dead, which was turned into a movie. The prison is now closed. Police say that the killings, that took place late on Saturday night, are not related to any football rivalry. A woman is comforted by a policeman as she talks on a mobile phone outside the fan club. The Corinthians team did not respond to a request for information but posted the word'mourning' against a black backdrop on its official Facebook page. Former president of the team and current federal congressman, Andres Sanchez, said on the social network he was 'deeply saddened to learn of what had happened at Pavilhao 9, with which I had a strong bond since I was a kid.'

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: A Soviet dissident who spent 12 years in prison and forced labour camps is to be charged with making and possessing indecent images of children after a police investigation. Vladimir Bukovsky, 72, has lived in the UK since he fled the Soviet Union in the 1970s after he was accused of spreading anti-Soviet propaganda. It came after he managed to smuggle to the West 150 pages of documents detailing the abuse of psychiatric institutions for political reasons in the Communist state. Soviet-era dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, who has been summonsed to appear in court next month to be charged with making and possessing indecent images of children. But now Bukovsky has been summonsed to appear at Cambridge Magistrates early next month following an investigation by Cambridgeshire Police, the Crown Prosecution Service said. He will be charged with five counts of making an indecent photograph of a child, five counts of possessing indecent photographs of children, and one count of possessing a prohibited image. Jenny Hopkins, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in the East of England, said: 'Following an investigation by Cambridgeshire Police, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to prosecute Vladimir Bukovsky in relation to the alleged making and possessing of indecent images of children.' She added: 'The decision to prosecute was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.' Bukovsky is a dissident, author and activist who spent 12 years in Soviet prisons, forced-labour camps and forced-treatment psychiatric hospitals. He was first arrested by the Soviet authorities when he was part of a group of young activists who held public readings of banned poetry and organised demonstrations against the heavy-handed tactics of the authorities. The revelations sparked an international outcry, and Bukovsky was arrested for the spread of anti-Soviet propaganda. In 1976 he finally secured his freedom when he was exchanged by the Soviet government for the Chilean Communist party leader Luis Corvalan. He was described by The Daily Telegraph as 'pale and haggard' and 'underfed with an accelerated heartbeat' after his long incarceration. Bukovsky will appear at Cambridge Magistrates Court, pictured, on May 5 after receiving a summons. He denies the allegations. He moved to Britain soon after and has lived in Cambridge ever since. He is a senior fellow at the libertarian think-tank the Cato Institute, according to its website.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Getting the best price for your unwanted wares online can seem like a fine art, but researchers have found a simple trick that could see your bids soar. Economists plotted how much goods listed on eBay sold for and discovered that items with precise prices attract higher offers than those with round numbers, such as $1,000. In fact, sellers who end their price with \u201800\u2019 typically receive offers that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices. US researchers claim that exact prices of goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers. This chart shows that when the posted initial price is of a round number (the red dots), like $1,000, the average counteroffer is much lower than if it is a non-round number (the blue circles), like $1,079. In terms of the study, the word 'odd' is used to represent an unusual number, and not the opposite of even. Competitive options for buyers and sellers can define a limit beyond which they will not go, but there is still a range of prices that fall within those limits, Professor of Strategic Management at University of Toronto, Joshua Gans, writes for\u00a0The Conversation. Within that range, sellers are looking for a higher price while buyers would like a lower one, so each has an incentive to signal to the other their willingness to be a tough negotiator. Sometimes, however, sellers may want to send a signal they are willing to be less tough, such as when they are keen to sell an item quickly. One method is to lower their starting price, but this isn\u2019t always desirable. Sellers on eBay who end their price with \u201800\u2019 typically receive offers for their goods that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices, such as this watch example. While eBay is used for auctions, the bulk of its business comes from 'Buy it now' sales, such as this iPhone. The study found that prices that end in '00' as above are more likely to sell quickly, but may not attract the most lucrative counter offers from sellers. Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California, Berkeley, have addressed the problem in a new paper. Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California looked at pricing strategies within the confines of eBay\u2019s so-called 'negotiation platform'.

The group claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans. Last October, the camp, which had flouted planning rules, appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal. But despite being given four months to leave the site without the chance to appeal, the group used a loophole to take their case to the Supreme Court. They claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Suddenly, after close to 14 years of international football and just 33 caps, Michael Carrick is the answer for England. He was very impressive against Italy in a friendly, true; and he has been an important influence on Manchester United\u2019s revival. Yet it would be unfortunate in the extreme if four consecutive England managers had all failed to spot a game-changing wizard in their midst. Here\u2019s the reality. Carrick has made nine competitive starts for England, and the majority have been ordinary at best. He played in the match against Ecuador in the 2006 World Cup, in which England were saved by a David Beckham free-kick, and was then dropped and replaced by the more energetic Owen Hargreaves for the quarter-final with Portugal. Michael Carrick played against Ecuador at the 2006 World Cup but was dropped for the quarter-final. England have won just four competitive matches when Carrick started, including against Poland. Carrick (left) played in the 2-0 defeat by Croatia which went a long way to England missing out on Euro 2008. Under Steve McClaren he started in the disastrous double header of a 0-0 home draw with Macedonia followed by a 2-0 defeat in Croatia \u2014 the results that effectively cost England\u2019s place at the 2008 European Championship. He was also part of unconvincing performances in Poland and, particularly, Montenegro under Roy Hodgson. England have won four competitive games in which Carrick has started \u2014 against Ecuador, and then San Marino, Poland and Lithuania, all at home. Ecuador were feisty opponents and Carrick struggled to match their intensity; the same in the second half in Montenegro, when England were overwhelmed and fortunate not to lose. The home draw with Macedonia \u2014 more than either defeat to Croatia \u2014 was the worst result of McClaren\u2019s reign. Carrick was hailed after an impressive performance for England in their friendly draw with Italy last week. Carrick has also been impressive in Manchester United's midfield under Louis van Gaal this season. So the idea that England managers are fools for consistently preferring Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard is misguided. Carrick had chances throughout his career, and little changed. Equally, in less than one year, between May 30, 2009, and May 9, 2010, Lampard scored more goals for club and country than Carrick has in his entire career. Gerrard took slightly longer \u2014 outscoring Carrick in entirety between October 24, 2007 and December 13, 2008. And it wasn\u2019t as if\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: The handwritten notes of Samir al- Khlifawi explains in detail how ISIS were able to take control in Syria by infiltrating villages and using spies. The rapid growth and establishment of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been far from an accidental rise of religious fanaticism, but a calculated move orchestrated by one of Saddam Hussein's closest men. A cache of documents, including the blueprints for an ISIS secret service and instructions on how to infiltrate and take control of local villages have been discovered in Syria, Der Spiegel reveals. The handwritten charts and notes of Samir al-Khlifawi, a former Iraqi Army colonel better known by nom de guerre Haji Bakr, explains in detail how ISIS were able to take control in the area. Earlier this month, MailOnline reported that ISIS militants are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 execution. Haji Bakr is widely considered to have been ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the Syrian Martyr's Brigade in January 2014. The new documents detailing the plans to take over Syrian villages and establish the caliphate, seen by the German magazine, were found in Haji Bakr's former home in Tal Rifaat, north of Aleppo in Syria, after his death. The 'blueprints' outline exactly how the group intended to infiltrate villages and cities by recruiting young men as spies and establishing a 'Stasi-like' secret service for internal surveillance. Haji Bakr writes how the group would open a 'Dawah office', an Islamic missionary centre, which would be used as a cover to screen young men for potential suitability. One or two men, in their late teens or early 20s, would then be asked to spy on their village on behalf of what would then become the Islamic State.

In 2013, the teen's family told media that an Atlanta hospital rejected him for heart transplant surgery due to what the hospital described in a letter as Stokes' \"history of non-compliance.\" At the time, Mark Bell was acting as a Stokes family spokesman. Bell told CNN that a doctor told the family that Anthony's low grades and time in juvenile detention factored into the hospital's decision to deny him a heart. \"The doctor made the decision that he wasn't a good candidate because of that,\" Bell said then. \"I guess he didn't think Anthony was going to be a productive citizen.\" About a week after Stokes' story made headlines, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta gave him a heart.

Jack Grealish was fantastic but Fabian Delph was the best player on the pitch. On Saturday, I said his battle with Jordan Henderson would be key to the game. There\u2019s no doubt who won that one. Delph was different class. He put in an all-action display and ran the game. He looked like the player we all felt he could become when he emerged at Leeds. He was outstanding. As for Grealish, for a young man to play like that on his first visit to Wembley was magnificent. Jack Grealish, Fabian Delph and Christian Benteke celebrate as Aston Villa  reached the FA Cup final. Delph shoots and scores against Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to put Aston Villa ahead at Wembley. He is quick but has a languid style, like Steve McManaman. When he drops his shoulder he sends defenders so far the other way they almost have to pay to get back in. Tim Sherwood has done a brilliant job with Villa. I was at Wembley and their fans turned up with a sense of expectancy, something they have not had in a long time. Tim deserves huge credit for that. He has ignited that team and got their passion and excitement back. Delph and Grealish, pictured with Gabrial Agbonlahor inside the  dressing room, impressed at Wembley.

Raymond Lee Fryberg Jr. was arraigned in Seattle on Thursday, nearly six months after his son Jaylen Fryberg killed four students at Marysville Pilchuck High School then himself. Fryberg had been the subject of a permanent domestic violence protection order that prohibited him from ever having firearms when he allegedly bought a Beretta pistol in January 2013. According to the criminal complaint, the order was against him in Tulalip Tribal Court in 2002 by a girlfriend who said he had threatened her, slapped her and pulled her hair. In court:\u00a0Raymond Lee Fryberg Jr. walks out of the Federal Courthouse in Seattle on Thursday after he pleaded not guilty to illegally possessing a firearm. His son Jaylen used the gun to kill four classmates last year. Support: Fryberg, who is accused of lying about whether he had a restraining order against him when he bought the gun in January 2013, attended court with eight friends and family members. He allegedly bought the firearm from a gun shop and answered 'no' on the federal firearms purchasing form when asked if he was the subject of a restraining order that prohibits him from 'harassing, stalking or threatening your child or an intimate partner'. Fryberg's lawyer, John Henry Browne, previously said that 'there was never an order prohibiting him from owning or even purchasing firearms' from the tribal court. The issue in court will be whether he lied on the federal purchasing form, Browne said. Michael Lee, a lawyer with Browne's firm who attended the arraignment, said 'there is a distinction between what comes from a state court and a tribal court' in terms of restrictions placed on the subject of the order. Lee said they would secure the tribal order through discovery to make that point. Had the protection order been filed in a state court instead of the tribal court, it would have been entered into a criminal records database and would have surfaced during a background check. Gunman:\u00a0Jaylen Fryberg, a freshman, shot dead four of his classmates then himself last October. But the order was never entered into any state or federal criminal databases because of a flawed reporting system between tribes and outside authorities.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year, shocking new figures have revealed. A\u00a0study\u00a0reported in the British Medical Journal found that\u00a090 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013\/14. The 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33.8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week. The shambolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of A&E visits, the researchers say. Lack of access:\u00a0Patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million GP appointments last year. The figures, from the GP Patient Survey, also show that patients who report worse access to conventional GP appointments are more likely to use out-of-hours   services. And surgeries where patients were able to see a GP within two week days had lower\u00a0rates of A&E department visits. Other research has suggested that greater access to GP surgeries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke. The figures\u00a0come\u00a0just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to A&E are unnecessary. A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete\u2019s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary \u2013 costing the NHS \u00a3290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a \u2018self-treatable condition\u2019. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Today's piece, written by academics from Imperial College London and New York University, points out that more GPs are required if access is to be improved. But they add politicians' promises of an extra 5,000 to 8,000 GPs are likely to be challenging to achieve.

A female employee accused Xavier Morales, a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at  her, according to The Washington Post. \"The woman told police and agency investigators that Morales, her boss, told her during the party at Capitol City Brewing Company that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her,\" and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from The Washington Post. During the incident, he \"grabbed her arms when she resisted\" and the two tussled until Morales gave up, sources told the paper. The Post reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of Morales' new assignment as head of the Louisville field office. A Secret Service spokesperson confirms that  Morales was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and Secret Service Director Joe Clancy was briefed that afternoon. Clancy called the allegations \"very disturbing.\" \"Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in  the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,\" he said in a statement. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a White House command post during an investigation of a possible bomb. Clancy was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the White House lawn. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the East Room of the White House. Earlier in September, an armed security contractor was allowed to get into an elevator with President Barack Obama during a trip to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

We've turned blind to their value and beauty. There are nearly 5,000 \"gems\" scattered across the country, ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments. Italy boasts the highest number of UNESCO World Heritage sites in the world -- 50, several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources. And there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides, floods and natural calamities. The UNESCO-listed Basilica of Assisi, where St. Frances' tomb lies, is just the last of a series of national shames. Its frescoed walls by Renaissance masters including Giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle. In a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500,000 euros. We're talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value. I remember once an American colleague asking me: \"But what does Italy do with its immense cultural heritage\"? Good question. If other nations had half as much of what we boast, they'd make a much better job with it. Paradoxically, if we had just the Coliseum or Venice it would be easier. But we don't and trouble is Italy doesn't know how to exploit this treasure. Take the British Museum's successful exhibition on Pompeii in 2013: we have the real site in our backyard but the British made the best of it worldwide while the real Pompeii was -- and still is -- making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses. Or, worse, Italy couldn't care less to promote its assets.

Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive \"kew-kew-kew\" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as \"cuff 'em and stuff 'em!\" upon making an arrest. Among the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games. Several of Best's \"Hazzard\" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media. \"I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,\" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. \"Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend.\" \"Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,\" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. \"Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions.\" Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana.

She is expected to avoid jail time, however, after paying \u00a310,000 bail and launching an appeal against the six month prison sentence. Offending dress: An Egyptian court has sentenced popular Armenian belly dancer 'Safinaz' to six months in prison for 'insulting the Egyptian flag' after she wore a tight dress in its red, white and black color scheme. Insulting the flag was made illegal by decree under Egyptian President Adly Mansour who ruled for a year after the army overthrew an elected but divisive Islamist president in 2013. The change in law made it a crime to raise, display or sell an\u00a0Egyptian flag if it is damaged in any way, or even if the colour has faded. The law also prohibits adding slogans, designs or pictures to the Egyptian flag. Ms Gourian is understood to have worn a costume made from the material taken from an Egyptian flag during a belly dancing performance in the town of Ain Sokhna in 2013. The belly dancer, who lives in Egypt, had argued that she did not insult the flag intentionally and as a foreigner was less aware of Egyptian laws.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Robbie Neilson insists the likes of captain Danny Wilson will only leave Hearts if he is satisfied it's right for the club. As Sportsmail revealed this week, Celtic have placed former Rangers defender Wilson on a list of potential summer recruits. Speaking ahead of Sunday's Championship clash with the Ibrox club, Neilson admitted external interest in his promoted players is inevitable. Hearts manager Robbie Neilson will not sell his players unless it is the right move for the club. Echoing the view of owner Ann Budge, however, the Tynecastle coach says departures will only happen on his say-so if the price is right. 'If you do really well in the Championship and the players excel then there is going to be interest,' admitted Neilson. 'That is football. 'There has been interest in a lot of my players and we have a few boys out of contract, who we are negotiating with at the moment. 'I would like to try to keep my best players but there is a realisation that bigger clubs can come in and take them. 'What I would say is: I wouldn't expect to lose anyone that I don't want to lose. If there are people I want to keep, I expect to keep them. Hearts have already secured promotion to the Scottish Premiership under Neilson's stewardship. 'If teams come in with an offer that is acceptable to us, then I'll expect to lose them. 'What I don't expect to happen is someone moves on and we are not happy about it. If someone leaves the club then it will be on terms that are acceptable to the club and the player.' Parkhead coach Ronny Deila admitted Wilson, a one-time \u00a32million signing for Liverpool, is on his list of potential replacements for Jason Denayer and Virgil van Dijk, linked with Sunderland and Southampton. With a shrug of resignation, Neilson added: 'People talk about how comments from other managers can unsettle you. I think it gives you a boost, because you realise that teams admire you and are interested in you. 'When no team is interested in you... that is what unsettles you. You start worrying when nobody is talking about you. If there is interest in players then it just shows that they are doing really well.

The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food. The 54-year-old found himself at the center of a firestorm last week when the doctors sent a letter to the university where Oz serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at College of Physicians. The doctors accused him of being a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' and as someone who 'has repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops'. 'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also,' he said on Thursday's show. A report followed revealing how some of the 10 doctors 'have big ties to big industry.' Four who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health. The organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds.

Indian Country Today Media Network spoke to one of the actors who walked off, Navajo Nation tribal member Loren Anthony, about his issues with the script. 'I was asked a long time ago to do some work on this and I wasn't down for it. Then they told me it was going to be a comedy, but it would not be racist,' said Anthony.

'We were supposed to be Apache, but it was really stereotypical and we did not look Apache at all. We looked more like Comanche,' he explained.

U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda. Weinstein -- a husband, father and grandfather from Rockville, Maryland -- was 73 years old when he was killed, according to a family website detailing information about his case.

Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Taxpayers are having to find \u00a311billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs. The money, which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved, is paid to some 5.2million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits. Campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table. The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages. The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by \u00a36.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the \u00a312billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is \u00a36.50 an hour and will rise to \u00a36.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity\u2019s report complains: \u2018The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.\u2019 Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s posted combined profits of \u00a33.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than \u00a3750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid \u00a3519m in tax but received \u00a3364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent \u00a3150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received \u00a3221m in benefits.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)As tourists stroll between Yellowstone's 300 active geysers, taking selfies in front of thousands of bubbling, boiling mud pots and hissing steam vents, they are treading on one of the planet's greatest time bombs. The park is a supervolcano so enormous, it has puzzled geophysicists for decades, but now a research group, using seismic technology to scan its depths, have made a bombshell discovery. Yellowstone's magma reserves are many magnitudes greater than previously thought, say scientists from the University of Utah. Underneath the national park's attractions and walking paths is enough hot rock to fill the Grand Canyon nearly 14 times over. Most of it is in a newly discovered magma reservoir, which the scientists featured in a study published on Thursday in the journal Science. It may help scientists better understand why Yellowstone's previous eruptions, in prehistoric times, were some of Earth's largest explosions in the last few million years. The Utah scientists also created the first three-dimensional depiction of the geothermal structure under Yellowstone, which comprises three parts. Yellowstone's ultimate heat source reaches down 440 to 1,800 miles beneath Earth's surface -- and may come from its molten core. It is responsible for fueling the newly discovered reservoir that lies on top of it. The magma chamber, which scientists already knew about, lies on top of the reservoir -- and draws magma from it. It is a three to nine miles under the surface of the Earth and is what fuels the geysers, steaming puddles and other hot attractions. It alone has a volume 2.5 times that of the Grand Canyon. But those great magma expanses do not mean that the two hellish hollows could overflow the Grand Canyon with molten rock. The overwhelming bulk of their magma cavities comprise scorching -- yet solid -- rock, which is hollow, like sponges, and filled with pockets of liquefied rock. Also, the discovery doesn't mean that there is now more magma than there was before, the scientists say. And they are no signs of an imminent eruption. \"The actual hazard is the same, but now we have a much better understanding of the complete crustal magma system,\" said researcher Robert B. Smith. An eruption in the next few thousand years is extremely unlikely, the USGS says. The Utah scientists put the yearly chance at 1 in 700,000 -- about the odds that you will be struck by lightning.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Alastair Cook may have had a long break working on his batting with his old mentor Graham Gooch but his technical problems very much remain. The England captain, without an international century for almost two years, failed for the second time in the first Test as his old failing against the full ball just outside off-stump was again exploited by West Indies. To compound Cook\u2019s misery, there was also another failure for Jonathan Trott, who has endured a nightmare return to the England team for his 50th Test, 18 months after the trauma of leaving the Ashes tour following his 49th. The double blow at the start of England\u2019s second innings left them with much to do in this first Test to work their way towards a winning position at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium even though they earned a first-innings lead of 104. Cook simply cannot afford many more mistakes, with new ECB chairman Colin Graves demanding victory here over opposition in West Indies he condemned as \u2018mediocre\u2019 ahead of this trip. Cook returned to something like his best last year with three half-centuries in his last four Test innings against India but his woeful one-day form in Sri Lanka led England to jettisoning him as 50-over captain ahead of the World Cup. He arrived in the Caribbean still smarting from that blow but with a slightly altered technique and looked refreshed in scoring a warm-up hundred against St Kitts. The step up to Test level, however, has seen Cook struggling and Jerome Taylor looked anything but mediocre in sending both him and Trott back with just 20 on the board as England endured a rocky start to their second innings. Trott has been recalled in the unaccustomed role of opener but has looked jittery in scoring a duck and now four and was noticeably falling over in the crease as he edged a decent ball from Taylor to Denesh Ramdin. Alastair Cook failed with the bat once again on day three of the first Test in Antigua. Jonathan Trott was also out cheaply as the first three wickets once again fell for not many. James Tredwell earlier picked up four wickets as England bowled West Indies out for 295 in their first innings. It is far too early to say that England\u2019s gamble in bringing back a man who left Australia with what was later diagnosed as \u2018situational anxiety\u2019 has backfired but Trott will be under significant pressure in the second Test.

Gregory Van der Wiel - 5.5 - Unlikely to have started had Thiago Silva and David Luiz been fit to play the full game and was struggled to cope with Neymar's trickery, speed and movement. Marquinhos - 6.5 - Another bold performance from the Brazilian. Difficult to believe he is only 20 years old. Barcelona's front three still had their moments but Marquinhos was generally in control. Thiago Silva - 5.5 - Injured early on and replaced by his compatriot David Luiz. PSG need their skipper back if they are to turn this around in the Camp Nou. PSG (left) missed their skipper, who was forced off, and will be praying he can play at the Nou Camp. Maxwell - 6 - The former Barcelona full-back will have been grateful for the suspension of Daniel Alves, allowing him a less stressful evening from a defensive point of view against the more conservative Martin Montoya. Good delivery going the other way. Blaise Matuidi - 7 - Powerful and determined, he inherited the captain's armband when Silva went off injured and produced a relentless midfield performance. You can understand why Manchester United scouted him so closely last season. Yohan Cabaye - 5 - A dreadful lunge on Iniesta summed up a difficult first half for the Frenchman. Lacks the ball quality of Marco Verratti and the defensive acumen of Thiago Motta, who were sorely missed in the midfield. Booked.

But the timing was right for the gang of British comedians (along with their token American, Terry Gilliam), who were looking to hit the big screen after four seasons of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" their groundbreaking British TV series. \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" which premiered 40 years ago Thursday, was the result. The movie, a spoof of the Arthurian legend, did not start auspiciously. The budget was small -- about $400,000, half of it supplied by rock stars, including Genesis and Pink Floyd. On the first day of filming in Scotland -- the first shot, in fact -- the camera broke. The weather was bad. The hotel was dismal. Python member Graham Chapman was suffering from alcohol withdrawal. It got better. On the day of its first American screening in New York, a thousand people were in line by 8 a.m. Thanks to the popularity of \"Python\" on American TV, the movie was a box-office hit, making $5 million -- more than 10 times its budget. More importantly, it soon became a comedy classic. The dialogue alone has been widely quoted, with such lines as \"It's just a flesh wound\" and \"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries\" referenced on shows such as \"The Simpsons,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and \"The Blacklist.\"  Python member Eric Idle turned the film into the Tony-winning Broadway play \"Spamalot.\" The troupe ended up making three movies -- well, four, if you count \"And Now for Something Completely Different,\" five if you include \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,\" five-and-a-half if you allow \"The Rutles,\" six if you... well, three.

From its dramatic opening credits featuring fake-Swedish subtitles to the adventures of Sir Launcelot (\"the boldest and most expensive of the knights\"), weighted-bird computations and sudden animator heart attacks, \"Holy Grail\" is probably the loosest and most Python-esque of the Python oeuvre.

Paladini tells the Arizona Republic that he was told the order came just before winds whipped Yarnell Hill into a deadly, all encompassing firestorm. Fatal orders? The Yarnell Hill Fire killed 19 firefighters in 2013, the worst disaster of its kind since 1933. New revelations now claim their deaths came after their supervisor gave orders for the crew to leave a safe zone.

Marsh ordered it, Paladini says, while his deputy\u00a0Jesse Steed warned against it. Whether or not Paladini's claim is true, neither man is alive to verify it. What's more, Paladini's claim is based on what he says he was told by Darrell Willis, former chief of woodland fires for the city. Paladini says McDonough told Willis about the deadly decision.

The Prime Minister will be absent when Mr Miliband and four other party leaders take part in the televised showdown, after agreeing to just one direct confrontation with his rival in the race for Number 10. Mr Miliband accused the PM of 'ducking' the chance to defend his record in government or explain how he would pay for a host of tax giveaways and spending pledges. Labour leader Ed Miliband addresses supporters during a visit to Crouch End in north London this morning. Mr Cameron has pledged to find \u00a37billion to pay for tax cuts for lower and middle earners, by lifting the point at which people start paying tax and the level when the 40p band kicks in. He has also promised to increase the NHS budget by \u00a38billion a year, while slashing welfare spending by \u00a312billion. Tonight's 'Challengers' Debate' will feature Mr Miliband, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Greens, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. The BBC1 debate, hosted by David Dimbleby at 8pm tonight, is the second TV showdown of the campaign, following an ITV broadcast on April 2, also featuring Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, from which no clear winner emerged. Speaking on a campaign visit to north London, Mr Miliband said: 'David Cameron has chosen not to turn up tonight to defend his record. 'Here's what I believe - I think if you are applying for the job of prime minister, the very least the British people expect is for you to turn up to the job interview.

That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. \"You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly,\" a woman is heard saying. \"All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.\" Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

In a letter sent to Coleman, the TSA said the re-training will stress 'race neutrality', and that a special emphasis will be placed on the 'hair patdowns of African-American female travelers'.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Holy smokes! Researchers found the bombardier beetle (pictured) mimics a machine gun by mixing chemicals in an internal'reaction chamber' A beetle with a machine gun built into its rear end sounds like something from a comic or sci-fi film - or the stuff of nightmares. But researchers have discovered the Bombardier beetle mimics this powerful weapon by mixing chemicals in an internal'reaction chamber' in its stomach. When threatened, the diminutive bug can then repeatedly fire streams of foul-smelling liquid from its rear, complete with 'gun smoke'. It can even precisely aim the nozzle at the attacker. This behaviour has been caught on camera by Wendy Moore and her colleagues at the University of Arizona. Many beetles secrete foul-smelling or bad-tasting chemicals from their abdomens to ward off predators, but bombardier beetles take it a step further. When threatened, they combine chemicals in an explosive chamber in their abdomen to simultaneously heat and propel their defensive load as a boiling hot spray. Assistant Professor Moore, from the Department of Entomology at the university, has published a paper along with her team that not only reveals the beetle's firing apparatus in never-before-seen detail, but also solves a long-standing mystery of how the animals achieve their incredible rapid-fire capabilities. 'Understanding how these beetles produce - and survive - repetitive explosions could provide new design principles for technologies such as blast mitigation and propulsion,' she said. The study was led by doctoral student Eric Arndt and Christine Ortiz in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Arndt and Ortiz teamed up with Professor Moore to study the anatomy of the beetle's reaction chamber, which is constructed of cuticle, a composite of chitin, proteins and waxes. The material, which also makes up the exoskeleton of insects, protects the beetle from the toxic chemicals, high temperatures and high pressures during explosions. A real hot shot! The research, including video footage (shown above) not only reveals the beetle's firing apparatus in never-before-seen detail, but also solves a long-standing mystery of how the bugs achieve their rapid-fire capabilities. The mechanism of the bombardier beetle's spray pulsation had not been understood because previous studies, relying on external observations, could not probe exactly what happens inside the reaction chamber of the chemical gun. African bombardier beetles can accurately hit targets in any direction.

'Having been informed the religion is not advising members to avoid vaccinating their children and following engagement with members, the government no longer sees that the exemption is current and the authorisation for this exemption has been withdrawn. 'Having resolved this outstanding matter the government will not be receiving nor authorising any further vaccination exemption applications from religious organisations. 'The only authorised exemption from being required to have children immunised in order to receive benefits is on medical grounds. 'While parents have the right to decide to not vaccinate their children, if they are doing so as a vaccination objector, they are no longer eligible for assistance from the Australian Government.' Minister for Social Services Scott Morrison has announced the end to religious exemption on children\u2019s vaccinations for access to childcare benefits. Parents who refuse to immunised their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child. The announcement comes after Mr Morrison said while immunising children against deadly diseases protects the wider society, it should be a prerequisite to receive tax payer money.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Former Cuban president Fidel Castro has appeared in public for the first time in more than a year, his first since his country reached a landmark agreement with the US to reestablish ties. The state-run Cubadebate website says Castro greeted a group of Venezuelans visiting the capital of Havana. Cubadebate on Friday published four images that show Castro sitting inside a bus, each with a different person stretching an arm through the window to shake his hand. Images of Fidel Castro meeting with Venezuelan visitors to Havana were reported in Cuban media on Friday, though the encounters were said to take place on Monday. The meetings, with photos taken inside Castro's bus, are the former president's first public appearance since January 2014. Castro's face is largely obscured by a dark-colored baseball cap. He sports longish gray hair and a beard. The website said the encounter occurred Monday, but did not explain the delay in publishing the photos. He is shown shaking hands, which Cubandebate said occurred 'for hours,' with Venezuelans in Havana who had come for solidarity events. Castro will turn 89 on Aug. 13. He was last seen in public at the inauguration of an artist's studio in January 2014. In February and March of this year, official Cuban media published photographs of Castro taken during private meetings with a Cuban student leader and with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. State media reports about the event said that Castro was 'full of vitality' and shook hands 'for hours' before going to a school. Castro, whose country has close ties with the leftist Venezuelan government, said that the South American country had become the target of 'imperial greed' Though Monday's reported appearance is his first in public since a landmark deal to reestablish ties between the US and Cuba, Castro met with spies released by the US in the agreement earlier this year. He also appeared with the Cuban agents who were freed from prison in December after a landmark agreement between the Obama administration and his brother Raul to reestablish ties between the island and the US. Fidel, older than his brother by five years, expressed skepticism about the deal, which includes plans for a US Embassy in Havana and has lessened travel restrictions. Cuban media said that Castro's meeting went off 'without the slightest of problems' and he urged his residents to write to Obama and urge him to stop saying that Venezuela y was a threat. It said that the former leader talked about how the South American country had become a target for 'imperial greed'.

Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury. It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training.a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries. Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Cellino is currently banned after being being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy. He has been banned from holding any influence over the club since the end of January and is set to return in a fortnight's time.

William, who unusually took his wife's surname when they got married, said: 'Three or four months went by, then another couple of months - I didn't have the courage to say anything about it, probably due to the fact of the age gap, and the fact she was my mate's mum.'

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was mocked by ex-PM Sir John Major over her demand to play a role in proper up a Labour government, when she is 'not even bothering' to stand as an MP herself. Sir John said that he had repeatedly warned in the 1990s that devolution to Scotland would make independence more, not less, likely. Labour had argued it would 'kill independence stone dead' but instead it 'fanned the flame' which lead to the referendum which left the Union 'battered' but intact. 'Now, it is at risk again,' he said. Labour's only route back to power is in hock to smaller, left wing parties, he said, leading to'more borrowing, more spending, an end to welfare reform, and far more people dragged into higher tax brackets'. Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru would demand more money for Wales while the 'worthy' Green party's economic plan is 'a recipe for economic self-harm'. He warned of'mayhem' if the SNP holds the balance of power, with a weak Labour government open to a 'daily dose of blackmail' to secure the support of the nationalists in Commons votes. The SNP would use its role in Westminster to bolster support ahead of next year's Scottish Parliament elections, when it will put independence back on the agenda, Sir John said. The Tories hope to capitalise on a damning poll which shows more than half of British voters want Ms Sturgeon and her party to play no part in the next government. 'The SNP is a real and present danger to our future,' Sir John said.\u00a0'They will pit Scotland against England. That could be disastrous to the people of Scotland \u2013 and fatal to the UK as a whole.' But Ms Sturgeon branded his comments 'an affront to democracy'. Addressing the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Ayr, she said that SNP MPs at Westminster could 'vigorously and loudly' support a future Labour government in some areas.

'I wouldn't say it has been a hard three weeks but it has been a three weeks that I have been able to learn a lot more about myself, so it has been a nice three weeks in that respect and good to get on the pitch again.' Shaw claims he had a minor back injury when he was substituted at half-time against Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final defeat at Old Trafford last month, but he was left out of the team by Louis van Gaal for the next four games. Shaw added: 'He has two sides to him, but he is genuinely a really nice guy and a great manager. 'You have seen what he has turned United into in recent weeks but that is because there is a really focused side, where you have to give 100 per cent in every training session and game and be focused all the time. 'If you don't give that, he won't play you and that's what he is like.' The 19-year-old has played 19 times in all competitions for United this campaign, after featuring in twice as many matches for Southampton last season. 'I haven't been playing and there have been a lot of negative comments about me,' he said. 'It is something that isn't nice and I've tried to ignore it but hopefully this is the start of me coming back. 'I saw a comment the other day saying I was taken off at half-time against Arsenal because I wasn't fit enough, but that's not true at all.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)Is there anything laser can't do? From cutting diamonds to preserving endangered sites, all the way to building terrifying weapons and turning your eyes from brown to blue, there is apparently no end to the list of applications for laser. Swiss physicist Jean-Pierre Wolf is working on yet another impressive addition to that list: using focused laser beams to affect the weather. It sounds like black magic, but it's actually a cleaner version of cloud seeding, a form of weather modification that has been used for several years -- most famously by China in preparation for the 2008 Olympics, when they launched rockets to seed the clouds and prevent rainfall during the opening ceremony. But it's hard to tell how effective cloud seeding actually is, and it involves the spraying of chemicals into the atmosphere, something which it surely doesn't need. Laser is therefore a completely clean alternative to traditional cloud seeding: it's light, and nothing but light. How does laser actually affect the weather? Just like cloud seeding, it can create new clouds where there are none, by inducing condensation: naturally occurring water vapor is condensed into droplets, and ice crystals form, mimicking the natural process that creates clouds. That way, rainfall can be triggered to \"empty\" the atmosphere and increase the potential of dry weather later on: \"We did it on a laboratory scale, we can already create clouds, but not on a macroscopic scale, so you don't see a big cloud coming out because the laser is not powerful enough and because of a lot of technical parameters that we can't yet control,\" Professor Wolf told CNN's Nick Glass. That is not to say that the laser he's tested isn't powerful: at one terawatt, it has the same energy produced by all the nuclear power plants on Earth: \"Of course, it doesn't last very long,\" Wolf said. The technology is still in its infancy then, but once it's perfected, it could help us modulate the weather in areas of high contrast, such as California or Chile, where flooding and droughts occur in extreme vicinity. Through lasers, those effects could be smoothed to have less rain in flooding-prone areas and more rain in drought-prone areas: \"You can transport the water to a different location,\" Wolf said. Laser seeding can make more than clouds: it can also trigger lightning. \"We also showed that it's possible to trigger lightning in clouds, within clouds, but not to the ground, yet.\" Recent tests have shown promise: \" A\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

He said 40 people were injured. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis, an ISIS affiliate, claimed responsibility for the attack, which came hours after another operation that the group also claimed. In that earlier attack, a first lieutenant, a sergeant and four conscripts were killed when their armored vehicle was attacked on the highway from Al-Arish to Sheikh Zuweid in northern Sinai, the military said. Two other soldiers were injured and taken to a military hospital. Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed many attacks against the army and police in Sinai. A third attack Sunday on a checkpoint in Rafah left three security personnel injured, after unknown assailants opened fire at them, according to state media. The attacks come as the military announced a reshuffle of several senior military positions, state media reported. Among those being replaced are the generals in charge of military intelligence and Egypt's second field army, which is spearheading the battle against the insurgents in the northern Sinai.

Rows over goal-line technology were hardly something new when Frank Lampard\u2019s infamous \u2018ghost\u2019 goal against Germany in the 2010 World Cup finally brought matters to a head. The 2000 Africa Cup of Nations Final between Nigeria and Cameroon had already been scarred by a similar howler while the world watched agog five years later as a Pedro Mendez effort which crossed the line at Old Trafford was incredibly missed by all the officials despite keeper Roy Carroll ending up tangled in the rigging. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings. Such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the Portuguese star that FIFA did, in fact, begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goal-line systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses. It took Lampard\u2019s ruled-out effort in Bloemfontein \u2013 with the ball being clearly a yard over Manuel Neuer\u2019s line in the last-16 match \u2013 for the dam to finally burst.

Perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the World Cup in Russia in three years\u2019 time will common sense prevail.

The broccoli chemical sulforaphane is known to block the inflammation and damage to cartilage associated with the condition. But patients would have to eat several pounds of the vegetable every day to derive any significant benefit. Sulforaphane in its natural form is also too unstable to turn into a medicine. But UK drug company Evgen Pharma has developed a stable synthetic version of the chemical that offers the potential of a pill treatment.

America has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with 5% of the world's population and 25% of its prisoners. Nearly 2\u00bd million Americans are in prison. Over 65 million people, or 20% of the country, have criminal records. Most disturbingly, nearly 40% of our country's prisoners are African-Americans, who only make up 13% of the general population. It's time for policymakers to address this criminal justice crisis head on. We must change the dismal status quo. We must start by asking a simple question: Why are so many Americans criminals? Look no further than Washington, which has spent the past century devising the most complicated \u2014 and nonsensical \u2014 criminal code known to man. The federal criminal code includes over 4,500 laws and counting, not to mention government regulations for which there are criminal penalties. The list of federal crimes is so long, so broad and so vague that you and I likely commit three felonies every day, unwittingly breaking numerous federal laws as we go about our daily business. No wonder America's prison population is out of control. Americans aren't addicted to crime; our politicians are addicted to criminalizing things. Sadly, the criminalization of Americans also traps them in poverty. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, incarceration leads to reduced wages (11% drop), employment (nine weeks lost annually), and earnings overall (40% annually). Making matters worse, over half of new prisoners are at or below the poverty line and three-quarters of former prisoners are sent back to jail within five years of their release. The deck is stacked against my generation in particular. Young adults are 10% of the population yet comprise 29% of the country's arrests. Young African-Americans are particularly at risk: They're 15 times more likely to be in prison than whites. No wonder 18-to-29-year-olds have the lowest level of trust of any age group that our justice system treats everyone equally. Thankfully, there is a bipartisan consensus in Washington that something needs to be done, and fast. On the left, civil rights groups and their allies in Congress have been demanding that the criminal system be fixed for years. On the right, politicians from Paul Ryan to Rand Paul are now recommending the same thing. If politicians are serious, they should consider three specific areas for reform. 1.

Researchers at Yahoo Labs in California have created a sensor that can recognise the shape of your ear or any other body part you want to access your device (shown) Bodyprint was devised by Christian Holz, Senaka Buthpitiya, and Marius Knaust from the California-based Yahoo Labs. Details of its algorithm are included in their\u00a0paper, Bodyprint: Biometric User Identification on Mobile Devices Using the Capacitive Touchscreen to Scan Body Parts. The Salt card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby. The credit card-sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of ten feet (three metres). Salt connects to an app on a user\u2019s Android handset or iPhone via Bluetooth and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet, where the firm suggests the Salt card is stored. The card was created by Illinois-based duo Joel Paglione and Niko Zistakis.. They claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year, based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day. 'Recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users biometrically and replace passwords, making authentication more convenient for users,' explained the researchers. 'However, due to their cost, capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top-of-the-line phones, a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor.' They continued that while the input resolution of a touchscreen is around six dots per inch (dpi) - meaning it can't capture the level of detail in a fingerprint - the surface area is larger than a more advanced reader. This allows the touch sensor 'to scan users\u2019 body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists, and palms by pressing them against the display.'

Writing in the BMJ, she said the Government had a \u2018duty to protect children from the risks of injury\u2019 as part of a law enshrined by the United Nations. \u2018Given that children are more susceptible to injuries such as concussion and often take longer to recover fully, the Government\u2019s plan to increase funding of and participation in rugby in schools in the absence of a comprehensive system for injury surveillance and prevention is worrying.\u2019 She added. \u2018Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short and long term effects of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known. \u2018Many countries, including the UK, have inadequate child injury surveillance systems. Under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child governments have a duty to protect children from risks of injury. Professor Allyson Pollock wants to see rugby made safer for children, with an end to scrums and tackles \u2014 where nearly all the injuries occur. \u2018The UK government should ensure the safety and effectiveness of sports and that injury surveillance and prevention strategies are established before proceeding with its plans to target funding and increase participation in a high risk collision sport such as rugby.\u2019 In New Zealand, the current holders of the Rugby World Cup, sports authorities monitor the number of rugby injuries compares to the population making it possible to work out how risky it is compared to other sports.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: John Carver has challenged his Newcastle players to relieve the pressure on their shoulders by adding another dent to Liverpool's Champions League hopes. The Reds have slipped to seven points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City as a result of successive defeats by Manchester United and Arsenal, although things could have been worse had the champions managed to emerge from Monday night's trip to Crystal Palace with something to show for their efforts. Brendan Rodgers' men ended their mini-slump on Wednesday evening with a 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final replay victory at Blackburn, and Carver knows they will will determined to add three points to that to keep alive their hopes of a top-four finish when the Magpies head for Anfield on Monday evening. John Carver says his players need to relieve the pressure of their shoulders with a win against Liverpool. He said: 'They are only seven points off it, I think, and they'll think they have still got a chance, seven points off it with seven games to go. 'I remember our football club having a huge gap for (to win) the championship and it dwindling away, so anything is possible.

Brendan Rodgers and his side have slipped out of the top four and out of Champions League contention. 'But there's a bit of pressure on ourselves as well.' That pressure comes specifically because of Sunday's 1-0 derby defeat at Sunderland, the Magpies' fifth successive reverse in the fixture, but more generally as a result of a run of 13 games in all competition under their current head coach which has brought just two victories. Newcastle have not added to their points tally of 35 since they beat Aston Villa on February 28, some four games ago, and have scored just once in the process. The Newcastle boss looks increasingly unlikely to get the job, with his results failing to impress. They remain nine points clear of the relegation zone, but with European challengers Tottenham heading for St James' Park next weekend, the situation could get worse before it gets better. Carver's cause has not been helped by an injury and suspension list which at some points has robbed him of an entire XI, and while there is light at the end of the tunnel for midfielders Rolando Aarons and Siem de Jong, the trip to Merseyside will come too soon.

HIV specialists and network security experts at University College London (UCL) made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spreads. They worked together to build a model for this 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off AIDS. Scroll down for video. Researchers creates a model 'hybrid spreading' which accurately predicted patients' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say the spread was similar to a computer virus. HIV infects CD4+ T-cells, which play a vital role in the immune system and protect us from diseases. As HIV progresses, it reduces the number of active T-cells in the body until the immune system cannot function correctly, a state known as 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' or AIDS. Current World Health Organisation guidelines, which the UK government follows, recommend only beginning HIV treatment when the number of T-cells in the bloodstream falls below a certain level. However, the new model predicts that treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing in the long term. The teams noticed that the spread of HIV through the body using two methods - via the bloodstream and directly between cells - was similar to how some computer worms spread through both the internet and local networks respectively to infect as many computers as possible. The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the highly damaging 'Conficker' worm, first detected in 2008, which has infected military and police computer networks across Europe and is still active today. Lead author Changwang Zhang, of UCL, said: 'HIV and Conficker have a lot in common. 'They both use hybrid spreading mechanisms, persist for a very long time and are incredibly difficult to eradicate. 'Our model enables us to explain these important properties and to predict the infection process.' Changwang's supervisor co-author Dr Shi Zhou said: 'Although the cybersecurity community organised an unprecedented collaboration to tackle Conficker, they still failed to eliminate Conficker from the Internet. 'HIV researchers face a similar problem. We hope that our new understanding of hybrid epidemics will help us to fight against Conficker and HIV.' Detailed sample data from 17 HIV patients from London were used to verify the model, showing that hybrid spreading provides the best explanation for HIV progression and highlighting the benefits of early treatment.

Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West. The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost \u00a31,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with'millions paying more while millionaires pay less' Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over \u00a3150,000 from 45p to 40p. Mr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires. 'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and \u00a31,100 a year worse-off? 'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards? 'How can this\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}
{"instructions":"[INST] Article: It's not something parking wardens are usually accused of... but some have been criticised for being too nice. An inspection in two Welsh towns found officers there were reluctant to issue tickets, letting many locals get away with parking offences. And their lax approach meant that parking in the evenings and at weekends had become a \u2018free for all\u2019. Inspectors in Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells have been accused of being too lax when it comes to giving out parking tickets for infringements (file picture) The investigation was carried out by officials from Powys County Council, who could not understand why the council was losing money on enforcing parking restrictions. Powys council needs to issue 40 per cent more tickets just to break even. Councillors shadowed wardens three times in the towns of Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells and found there were plenty of infringements, but many were going unticketed. In one case, a driver had already overrun their allotted time by 15 minutes, but the warden \u2018still appeared to be reluctant to issue the ticket\u2019. Officials also often did not penalise tradesmen for parking in restricted areas \u2013 even though only water and electricity vehicles are allowed to stop in them without permits. The councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers \u2018would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule\u2019. Even when tickets were issued, 39 per cent were cancelled at the first challenge. The councillors said some of the conversations they overheard between residents and officers \u2018would indicate that paying to park may be the exception rather than the rule\u2019 (file picture) The investigators suggested a range of actions to toughen up the operation, including shortening the grace period drivers are given after their time runs out before a ticket is issued. They said wardens are currently leaving it \u2018too long\u2019, particularly since the process to issue a ticket itself takes seven minutes and can be aborted at any time. They also said ticketing policies need to be more consistent across Powys as \u2018decisions are made locally and sometimes contrary to police recommendations\u2019. Some 5,000 tickets are issued in Powys, bringing in \u00a31.2million a year, but the council is still subsidising the operation. The report said 7,000 tickets would need to be issued to make the service \u2018cost neutral\u2019.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: A transgender South Carolina teenager who was told to remove her makeup for a driver's license photo has settled her lawsuit over the incident and a state agency has agreed to handle such cases differently, according to court documents. Under the terms of the settlement, the state DMV is changing its policy on how male and female license applicants may dress or wear makeup in their official photos. Agency employees will also get training on how to handle transgender customers and people who don't identify with either gender. Transgender teen Chase Culpepper, 17, who was born male but identifies as female, was told by DMV officials that she had to remove make-up (left) for her license photo last year (after taking off make-up right). After a legal battle, the policy has been changed and Miss Culpepper was allowed to wear makeup for her ID. The 17-year-old transgender teen won her legal battle against\u00a0the state DMV to appear in her license with make-up and jewelry. Chase Culpepper, 17, who was born male but now identifies as female, regularly wears makeup and androgynous or women's clothing. After passing a driving test last year, she was told by officials at a DMV office in Anderson, about 100 miles northwest of Columbia, to remove her makeup because of a policy that bans license photos when someone is purposefully altering his or her appearance. After several attempts, Culpepper says the makeup was removed to the satisfaction of DMV employees, and a license photo was ultimately taken, a process the teen called degrading and humiliating. Culpepper and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New York legal defense group, wrote to DMV officials, asking that Culpepper be allowed to take a new photo. They eventually sued the agency, calling the policy unconstitutionally vague. In a release from the defense fund, Culpepper said she was pleased with the settlement, which also includes a requirement that the DMV officially apologize to her and allow her to take a license photo with her everyday makeup. 'My clothing and makeup reflect who I am,' Culpepper said. 'From day one, all I wanted was to get a driver's license that looks like me. Now I will be able to do that.' Under the settlement, the DMV also agrees to alter its policy to allow people to wear makeup in photos regardless of their gender.

Prosecutors previously said that Robert Dellinger, 54, told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across a median at more than 100mph and plowed into an oncoming SUV. The crash killed 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was eight months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Speaking out: Former Fortune 500 executive Robert Dellinger, 54, said in court during his sentencing Wednesday that he was not suicidal on the day he crashed into a couple's SUV, killing them instantly. Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013. Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth. During the first day of what is expected to be a two-day sentencing, the former executive at PPG Industries Inc told the court he has 'never been suicidal.,' according to Valley News. Deborah Dellinger, the defendant's wife, described her husband from the witness stand Wednesday as a'man of ethics, integrity and friendship' who has lived his life with 'grace and modesty,' despite being plagued with serious health problems. Addressing the victims' families sitting in the courtroom, Mrs Dellinger said: 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones. We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median in December 2013. Dellinger pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide in the deaths of the young couple and to one count of assault for the fetus' death. He faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes Thursday. The defendant also faces a wrongful death lawsuit filed in February by the estate of Amanda Murphy. Robert Dellinger's attorneys claimed that the former high-powered executive was suffering from Ambien withdrawal, the effects of a psychiatric drug overdose and Prozac, and the advanced symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Dellinger, who held high-level posts at PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., told investigators he was trying to kill\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}
{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Hanging on one 93-year-old man's wall at a Kentucky nursing home was a photo collage of him and his wife. It was titled 'Lill & Bill, together forever'. That sentiment came true this week when, after 73 years of marriage, William 'Wild Bill' Wilson and his wife Lillian Karr Wilson died just two minutes apart from each other. Both Lillian, 89, and Bill were Alzheimer's patients and for the last couple of years had to live in separate nursing homes. Lillian resided at Richmond Place in Lexington, while Bill stayed at the Thomson-Hood Veterans Center in Wilmore. After 73 years of marriage, high school sweethearts Doug Wilson, 93, and Lillian Kerr Wilson, 89, passed away just two minutes apart from each other this week. But on Tuesday their connection proved strong as ever when one of their sons, Doug, received a phone call at 3.52am to inform him that his father had passed away. Just five minutes later the phone rang again. Doug said it was his mother's nursing home, calling with the same sad news. 'We all look at it as a blessing,' Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader, 'because we're going to have one funeral for both of them.' Doug, 66, believes it will also make it easier for the family to grieve. 'We\u2019re looking at it as a celebration of life because they had a great life,' he told the Washington Post. The couple first met in Corbin, where they were both athletes and high school sweethearts. Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader that his parents ran off to get married and that he doesn't believe 'either one of them had the blessings of their parents.' But that didn't stop the couple, who survived a war and a number of relocations through their long marriage. Bill enlisted in the Army when World War II began. After returning from Germany, he worked and managed various department and retail stores. Doug told the Washington Post that his mother, who he said 'had great taste', could be found working alongside her husband as she designed the showroom windows. The family, which also included Doug's brothers Mike and Terry, hopped around the state and country. There were setbacks along the way.

That is where clubs at the top level can look down at the Championship and below to take their pick of the players trying to impress. Yet it can be a case of hit and miss. Here,\u00a0Sportsmail looks at examples of players who have represented the lower leagues well in the Premier League, and others who can do so too. Aaron Cresswell (Ipswich Town to West Ham in July 2014 \u2013 \u00a32million) The full-back is one of just five outfield players to play every minute of his team's Premier League games this season. Cresswell began at Tranmere Rovers, making his debut in November 2008. From there, he moved to Ipswich in June 2011, apparently turning down West Bromwich Albion and Doncaster Rovers. He won the Supporters Player of the Year award, and was linked with Aston Villa. Yet it was West Ham who signed the left-back on a five-year contract, spending just \u00a32m in doing so. Cresswell has made 32 appearances in the Premier League since, and his impressive performances have reportedly caught the eye of Manchester City and Chelsea. Both clubs need to add more home-grown talent to their squads, and the West Ham regular would add to that batch. Aaron Cresswell has proved a good fit for the Premier League since signing for West Ham in July 2014. John Stones (Barnsley to Everton in January 2013 - \u00a33m) Stones has the best passing accuracy of any Everton player this season - 90.8%. A Barnsley youth product, Stones made 25 appearances in the Championship for the club, before leaving for Everton on a five-and-a-half-year deal. It reportedly cost them \u00a33m, and he has made 38 appearances in the Premier League since. Despite an ankle injury which ruled him out for 10-14 weeks, Stones was nominated for the Golden Boy 2014 award alongside Gerard Deulofeu, Calum Chambers, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw. During his time in the top flight, he has earned four caps for England. Another potential star. John Stones signed for Everton from Barnsley in January 2013 for just \u00a33m and has been a good addition. Andrew Robertson (Dundee United to Hull City in July 2014 - \u00a32.85m) Robertson has made 40 dribbles this year, 17 more\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

From Jermain Defoe's match-winning volley in the Tyne-Wear derby on Sunday, to Charlie Adam's audacious long-range effort against Chelsea on Saturday evening, there's plenty to choose from. Here, Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp picks his top five goals of the weekend and explains why they've made his list. 5. Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) vs Liverpool. I can't believe I have to make this goal No 5 in my list. It just shows the calibre of the goals scored this weekend. The Chilean took a brilliant first touch before spinning to lash it home and cap a fine Arsenal move \u2014 and a breathless first half. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez puts the Gunners 3-0 up against Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday. The Chilean runs off to celebrate after beating Simon Mignolet from outside the Liverpool area.

He showed incredible awareness to see the chance was on but was even quicker to sort out his feet and lift it over Boaz Myhill. Like Defoe's, it was a hugely important goal for his team and part of a superb performance. QPR's Bobby Zamora (left) gets in front of Joleon Lescott to score his side's third goal against West Brom. Charlie Austin congratulates his strike partner on his goal  during QPR's 4-1 victory at the Hawthorns. 3. Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) vs Aston Villa. Any other week and this would be being talked about in the same breath as Wayne's overhead kick against City. To flick it up with one foot, pivot and then hit it with your other is as difficult a skill as you could wish to see, but he made it look effortless. Wayne Rooney swivels to blast a right-footed shot into the top corner of Aston Villa's net on Saturday. The Man United captain's effort flies past Nathan Baker (left) and Fabian Delph on its way towards goal. 2. Jermain Defoe (Sunderland) vs Newcastle United.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Researchers sketching out a 'wiring diagram' for rat brains have discovered its structure is organized like the Internet. They say the animal's cerebral cortex is 'like a mini-Internet'. The first comprehensive picture of how neurons connect to one another found local networks of neurons layered like the shells in a Russian nesting doll. The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. The brain operates in a similar way, the researchers found. 'The cerebral cortex is like a mini-Internet,' said Larry Swanson, professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and corresponding author of a paper on the discovery. 'The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. 'The brain operates in a similar way.' The study was published on April 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For years, scientists looking for clues to brain function through its structure focused on what could be seen \u2014 the brain's lobes, grooves and folds. Two local networks \u2014 one governing vision and learning, and another tapped into bodily concerns like muscle and organ function \u2014 make up the inner shell of the rat's cerebral cortex. Two others \u2014 one governing smell, and another that assembles and makes sense of the information from the other three networks \u2014 make up the outer shell. This means that certain flows of information are genetically 'hardwired' into the brain, Swanson said. The discovery is the result of a massive, labor-intensive effort to organize 40 years' worth of data from peer-reviewed research articles detailing connections in rat brains. 'The data was already out there; it just needed to be compiled into a more useful format,' Swanson said. Lead author Mihail Bota of USC Dornsife created the database from more than 16,000 reports of connections, which he weighted both on the strength of the connection and the reliability of the methodology used to discover it. The process took more than 4,000 hours to complete, yielding a database that is free and available. Olaf Sporns of Indiana University subsequently performed a network analysis of the connections. A color-coded flat map of 1,923 rat cortical association macroconnections (RCAMs). The team used studies of rat brains because of the sheer volume of detailed information available.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Since it was revealed that Andreas Lubitz \u2013 the co-pilot who purposefully crashed Germanwings Flight 9525, killing 150 people \u2013 had been treated for psychiatric illness, a debate has ensued over whether privacy laws regarding medical records should be less strict when it comes to professions that carry special responsibilities. It has been widely argued that Germany's privacy laws were to blame for the tragedy. The Times, for example, ran an article with the headline: 'German obsession with privacy let killer pilot fly.' Similarly, another article published in TIME said: 'German privacy laws let pilot 'hide' his illness from employers.' While Dirk Fischer, German lawmaker and the transport spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), called for airlines to have mandatory access to pilots' medical records, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, president of the German Medical Association (B\u00c4K), disagreed. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who purposefully crashed Germanwings Flight 9525, killing 150 people, had been treated for a psychiatric illness, it later emerged. The discovery sparked a debate over whether airlines should be given greater access to pilots' medical records. Mr Montgomery believes that current laws are appropriate, since aviation doctors are already relieved of their duties of confidentiality if they think a pilot could put other people's lives at risk. If Lubitz's doctor did not alert Germanwings, it must have been because Lubitz did not seem like a threat. There are two arguments for why Lubitz's doctor did the right thing by not disclosing Lubitz's depression to his employer. First, functional doctor-patient relationships depend on trust. If confidentiality between patients and doctors is breached, patients will no longer trust their doctors. And a lack of trust will lead (at least some) patients to hide some of their symptoms or refrain from seeking medical attention altogether for fear of bad consequences, such as stigmatisation and work-related penalties. More dangerous than a pilot with a mental illness \u2013 or any number of other professions that carry the responsibility of a great many lives \u2013 is that one with a mental illness who will not seek treatment because he does not trust his doctor. For these reasons, philosopher Kenneth Kipnis goes even further. The passenger jet crashed in Seyne-les-Alpes, France while en route from Barcalona to Dusseldorf. All 150 people on board were killed on impact. He argues that confidentiality should be 'far closer to an absolute obligation that it has generally taken to be' and that doctors should honour confidentiality even in cases where the patient might harm a\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

The low-key video she released on Sunday announcing her run for the White House is filled with women -- young, old, black, white, Asian and Latina -- working in their gardens, taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world. Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others. \"I'm getting ready to do something, too. I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video. \"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\" Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present. She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president. The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist. \"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University.  \"People are ready for a woman president.  The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\" According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again.

It will also claim nearly two million more patients are unhappy with doctors opening hours compared to three years ago as they lose access to appointments outside of office hours. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will say the figures are a timely reminder of the \u2018NHS crisis\u2019 as patients turn to stretched A&E departments as they struggle to get an appointment with their GP on the first working day after the Easter break. But the Tories last night claimed many of the problems stemmed from Labour\u2019s 2004 changes to GP contracts that allowed them to opt out of providing care outside office hours. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said that the government had already begun tackling the issue by making extra funding available, which will mean the number of GP surgeries opening longer will have increased when the next set of figures are published. As it unveils its new poster, Labour will release a new document that it claims shows how David Cameron has failed to implement seven-day opening for GP surgeries as he promised before the last election. The original poster depicts a queue to an Unemployment Office. Mr Cameron repeated the pledge at last week\u2019s televised leaders debate, claiming he wanted GPs to open \u2018all the way through the week\u2019.

But one thing is for certain: it definitely took guts. With a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion, it can be revealed that Prince Andrew has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in Calcutta. Rescued from brothels and domestic servitude, child labour and human trafficking, the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called Key to Freedom. Moved: Prince Andrew during his visit to an Indian refuge in 2012, which inspired him to form the charity. Their kimonos, duster coats, pyjamas, scarves and make-up bags are sold online and on the British High Street by Topshop, with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary. What makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after Andrew was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with American \u2018sex slave\u2019 Virginia Roberts, who had been working for his former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire. The claims, furiously denied by the Duke, have now been struck out of American court records, effectively clearing his name. He was inspired to launch Key to Freedom after visiting a girls\u2019 refuge on an official trip to India. He came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation and swiftly donated \u00a310,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday yesterday, the Duke said: \u2018I was incredibly impressed with the work of the Women\u2019s Interlink Foundation during my Diamond Jubilee visit to India in May 2012. \u2018I could see that it would be possible to complement [founder and chairman] Aloka Mitra\u2019s important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products. It is incredible to see what the team has achieved.

The multi-millionaire, from Aberdeen, is in the midst of an ugly public battle over allegations he swore at workers at the LAX outlet. Despite bearing the Kitson name - Mr Ross' middle-name - the two stores in LAX are not run by him. Instead, another business called Hudson pays Kitson a licensing fee to use the brand.

Brian Timmons, a lawyer for Hudson, said:\u00a0'This is like a dysfunctional marriage that has been going on for a long time.' In 2013, Hudson inserted a clause into the contract with Kitson, giving it power to veto any Kitson employee coming to the airport stores. Mr Timmons claims that the firm abided by the agreement until last spring, when Mr Ross began showing up without warning and behaving 'inappropriately' toward employees.

Refused service: Couple Robert Ingersoll (left) and Curt Freed (right) were longtime customers at Stutzman's shop, and while she was fine providing them flowers before, she cited her religious beliefs when declining to service their wedding. Stutzman, owner of Arlene's Flowers and Gifts in Richland, Washington, received the fine in Benton County Superior Court in March after refusing to serve same-sex couple Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed\u00a0in 2013. When longtime customer Ingersoll came to Arlene's Flowers and asked for the flowers, the devout Southern Baptist told him her'relationship with Jesus Christ' wouldn't allow her to do the wedding. After they were refused flowers, Ingersoll and Freed went ahead with a smaller wedding than they had planned. They got married in their home with 11 guests and flowers from another florist. In a February ruling, Benton County Superior Judge Alexander Ekstrom found that Stutzman's refusal to provide flowers because of sexual orientation violated Washington's anti-discrimination and consumer protection laws. Along with the fine, the judge's ruling also requires that everything Arlene's Flowers sells to opposite-sex couples has to be available at the same price to same-sex couples. Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office requested the fine, said in a statement Friday that the ruling is a reminder of the reach of Washington's anti-discrimination laws.

'Merchants need to be transparent about fees and charges where credit card surcharges apply so that consumers can consider using other payment methods without any additional costs,' Mr Kell said. 'Consumers should also be mindful that payments by contactless or 'tap and go' cards are currently treated as credit card transactions, meaning that fees may apply where there are surcharges in place, even where they are using a debit card.' In ALDI stores all credit card transactions and all tap and go payments attract the 0.5 percent surcharge, irrespective of whether customers use a debit\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Pearson said: 'On a professional level I have one or two people I speak to if there's something I need a bit of feedback on. Howard Wilkinson is one. 'I have a lot of respect for people I have worked with. I have friends and family I speak to, my wife remains a very important person for me in terms of getting a balanced view on life.

But time and again it ends with a black man dead in the street and the community has no recourse. This time the stage was set in North Charleston, South Carolina, a city of about 100,000 people. Walter Scott was stopped by Officer Michael Slager for a broken taillight, and within minutes Scott was dead. According to the incident report, Slager said: \"Shots fired, and the subject is down. He took my Taser.\" His attorney at the time, David Aylor, said that Slager \"felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.\" But then came the video. We watched in horror as we saw Slager shoot Scott in the back multiple times. Then we saw Slager pick up something from one location and place it near Scott's lifeless body. On Tuesday, the officer was arrested on murder charges. North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters, \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw.\" Apparently so was Slager's attorney, who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer. After the video became public, the officials in North Charleston deftly handled the situation. However, it was an easy case. There is no plausible evidence that Slager feared for his life when Scott is seen running away.

Scott was hit five times. If words were exchanged between the men, they're are not audible on the tape. It's unclear what happened before Scott ran, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser on Scott, who, Slager said, tried to take the weapon. Before Slager opens fire, the video shows a dark object falling behind Scott and hitting the ground. It's unclear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, Slager appears to drop a dark object near Scott. Slager is seen in the video handcuffing Scott after the shooting.

The ex-Chelsea defender came off the bench in Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final first leg and was nutmegged twice by Luis Suarez in the build-up to the Uruguayan's two goals. Luiz suffered a hamstring injury 10 days ago but Hoddle, who insists that the Brazilian has always been a defensive liability, believes he still showed his naivety even if he wasn't fully fit. Luis Suarez puts the ball through David Luiz's legs on his way to scoring his second goal of the night. Luiz suffered the same fate when Suarez weaved his way into the box for Barcelona's second goal. The Brazilian was left with his head in his hands after allowing Suarez a clean run at goal. Asked about Luiz's defending for Barcelona's third goal, the Sky Sports pundit said: 'Even if you're not 100 per cent fit you can't show that lack of intent. 'He's the last man on the pitch when Suarez picks the ball up and starts running at him. He realises he's the last man and the very last thing (you should do) when you're last man is jump in. You bide time for your team to get around you. 'He does what an eight year old who hasn't been coached does. He tries to win it by putting both of his feet together but when he does that he can't move anywhere. Suarez nutmegs him again.' Some of Luiz's best performances for PSG - and former club Chelsea - came when he was deployed in a central midfield role with less defensive responsibility, something Hoddle believes manager Laurent Blanc should consider from now on.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)For the fifth year in a row in 2014, ambush attacks on police officers were the No. 1 cause of felonious deaths of law enforcement officers in the line of duty. Nevertheless, Google continues to market a smartphone application that lets lawbreakers pinpoint the location of police officers in the field. Google's executives won't even discuss the subject with organizations representing law enforcement. Google's popular real-time traffic app, Waze, uses GPS navigation and crowdsourcing to alert users to traffic jams, automobile accidents, stalled cars, and through its \"traffic cop\" feature, the presence of law enforcement. Most people undoubtedly use Waze's police-finding feature to avoid traffic tickets, but the app poses an enormous risk to deputies and police officers. In the days before he assassinated New York police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu at point blank range while they sat in their patrol car last December, Ismaaiyl Brinsley is known to have used the Waze application to monitor the movements of police officers. The killer identified the location of police on his own Waze account and even posted screen captures to Instagram. While Google (which acquired Waze in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion) claims the app \"is all about contributing to the 'common good' out there on the road,\" the risks far outweigh the potential benefits. Every day, thousands of police officers and deputies enforce traffic laws, execute arrest and search warrants, investigate domestic violence complaints and perform countless tasks that are needed to keep our neighborhoods safe and remove criminals from the streets. It takes just a couple of clicks on Waze's \"traffic cop\" icon to identify their locations and indicate whether -- in the opinion of the anonymous user -- the officer is \"visible\" or \"invisible.\" At that moment, the officer or deputy becomes an identifiable target whose whereabouts are available to any one of Waze's 50 million users worldwide. Social media has made enormous contributions to law enforcement as a \"force multiplier\" that lets citizens help police protect our communities. As we have seen with the emergence of crimes like identity theft, however, technology has the potential for evil as well as good. In the case of Waze, we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies, whose roles in society are to protect our citizens and enforce the laws that keep our communities safe.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)Fifty years ago in Frankfurt, German prosecutors tried 22 former Nazi SS soldiers at Auschwitz in what remains the most famous Holocaust trial staged in Germany. At the time, Fritz Bauer, the German-Jewish attorney general of Hessen, expressed the simple hope that \"sooner or later, one of the accused would step forward and say: 'What took place -- it was horrific, I'm sorry.' Then the entire world would exhale, as would all the survivors of those killed at Auschwitz, and the air would be cleared.\" Sadly, Bauer observed, \"it has not been uttered, nor will it be.\" The refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of Holocaust trials. John Demjanjuk, whose conviction by a Munich court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of Oskar Gr\u00f6ning, remained defiantly silent during his 18-month trial, never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse. Over the years, some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations, but have insisted that they played no role. Those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb. Over the years, an extraordinary research effort was dedicated to exploring the claim that SS men had engaged in extermination out of duress. The results were astonishing: Investigators and historians failed to uncover so much as a single instance in which a German officer or NCO had been executed or even severely punished for opting out of genocide. Not one. These evasions and lies were often effective, as many German trials of Holocaust perpetrators ended either in light sentences or outright acquittal. And even when a trial ended in a conviction, what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning, an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide. Fritz Bauer can now exhale. On April 21, on the opening day of his trial in L\u00fcneburg, where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 Jews during his service at Auschwitz, the 93-year-old Gr\u00f6ning faced the court and acknowledged, \"It is beyond question that I am morally complicit. This moral guilt I acknowledge here, before the victims, with regret and humility.\" If nothing else comes from the trial, that statement alone justifies the undertaking. Of course, in acknowledging his moral complicity, Gr\u00f6ning fell short of confessing legal guilt.

The museum yesterday handed over seven rare artifacts in its possession after authorities found, to the shock of museum officials, that they had been smuggled into the U.S. by former New York art dealer Subhash Kapoor. Agents from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will take the items back to New York and, from there, eventually return them to the government of India. Marc Thomas, chief preparator at the Honolulu Museum of Art, holds one of seven stolen artifacts that were on display in the museum's collection. The artifacts are believed to have been smuggled into the U.S. by an art dealer facing charges in India. The items' origin was discovered after a tourist visiting the museum noticed the dealer, Subhash Kapoor, was listed as their source. Dealer Kapoor, was arrested in 2011 and is awaiting trial in India. Officials say he created false provenances for the antiquities. The discovery was made after a visitor last year recognized the name of Kapoor's New York gallery as the source of a 2,000-year-old terra cotta rattle and contacted authorities, said Stephan Jost, the museum's director. Museum officials then pored over their records and determined six other Indian items had ties to Kapoor. He said Kapoor donated one of the items and sold five to the museum, while one was a gift from someone else. Agents are hailing the Honolulu museum for being the first U.S. institution to publicly and easily cooperate with the investigation, dubbed 'Operation Hidden Idol,' involving four arrests and the recovery of thousands of pieces worth a total of $150 million. 'Owning stolen stuff is not part of our mission,' Mr Jost said. 'I'm not sure we've done anything heroic. We just want to do the right thing.'

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)Be afraid -- be very afraid. This is the warning the world deserves to hear. Because the leader of the free world refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century: the fruits of radical Islam. The results of the Obama White House's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical Islam in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia. Not to mention here in the United States, Canada and Europe. Is it not a tragic irony that the Arab Spring-era policies of a Nobel Peace Prize recipient accommodated the transition of Syria into the world's newest jihad theater while leaving Libya a failed state and Yemen a failing state? The Syrian jihad gave rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which now uses Syria as a rear operating base to support its jihad in Iraq, which could soon spill over into Jordan. Plus, Libya is now being used as a rear operating base by ISIS and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the Middle East, even as they plan attacks in Europe and North America. Given the frightfully slow pace America's commander-in-chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both ISIS and its progenitor, al Qaeda, the picture of what's in store is clear: The body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy-in for their agendas. And neither the United States nor our Western allies are immune to this cancer. Academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of ISIS and al Qaeda as distinctly different. But the fact is they are not -- their agendas, which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today, are manifestations of radical Islam. Of course, it's hardly a surprise President Barack Obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven na\u00efve, with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is, but as they hope it could be. There is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the world's most powerful politician and his national security team.

The Abbey, which lies at the heart of Britain's only World Heritage city, was granted planning permission for the unique \u00a318million scheme two years ago. Engineers plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into a Roman drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water empties every day into the ground. They hope to divert the warm water instead through a network of underground pipes to provide a world-first natural underfloor heating system for the abbey. Church leaders believe the plans would provide a unique source of green energy for the abbey and help the 10th century building reconnect with the city's Roman roots. Plans show how Bath Abbey will use water from the city's ancient springs, which heat water used in its Roan Baths. Waste water currently filters out to the River Avon but could be put to use under the new scheme. An artist's impression of plans for Bath Abbey shows how the ground will be excavated to create the heating system, new work space and song school. Today, excavation work is taking place on Kingston Parade outside the Visitor\u2019s Information Centre to determine the feasibility of installing the system. Each day, a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the Roman Baths from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site. A large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby River Avon \u2013 passing through the Great Roman Drain. The idea is, that it this waste water was harnessed correctly and converted, it could produce 1.5 megawatts of continuous energy \u2013 enough to heat Bath Abbey and the world-famous Roman Baths and Pump Room complex. Engineers are currently digging 13 ft (4 metres) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer. Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp. The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times. Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year.

SpaceX has released dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a drone barge in the Atlantic Ocean. The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. The video, taken from a plane yesterday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side. The booster manages to hit the barge, but its high speed and tilt creates a huge explosion on impact. United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs.

Just a month before the tragedy, the council sent workers to inspect the hole after police said it was a hazard. But it was decided that immediate repairs were not necessary. Kate Uzzell has received a six-figure payout after her husband Martyn (both pictured) was killed during a charity cycle ride when he was thrown into the path of a four-inch deep pothole. Tragedy: Experienced cyclist Mr Uzzell, 51, was riding from Land's End to John O'Groats for Macmillan Cancer Support when he died. Coroner Rob Turnbull told Mr Uzzell's inquest last year that there was \u2018no doubt whatsoever that the condition of the road on that occasion was the cause of the incident\u2019. He said the pothole, which surrounded a roadside drain on the A65 near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, had \u2018existed for some time prior to the accident\u2019. A month before the tragedy in 2011, a traffic policeman saw the hole and his control room alerted their council counterparts, but the alert was not passed on to the highway inspection team. In the following weeks, the council inspected the road twice but failed to take any action before Mr Uzzell cycled along it with two friends raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. He was flung from his bicycle by the pothole, landing in the path of a car and suffering fatal head injuries. His widow Kate Uzzell, 49, from Clevedon, North Somerset, has now reached an out of court settlement with North Yorkshire County Council. However the local authority is still refusing to apologise for the state of the road in the lead up to the cyclist's death. A coroner previously ruled that the state of the  A65 (pictured), near Giggleswick, North Yorkshire, was 'the cause of the incident' After the inquest last year, Mrs Uzzell said the death of her husband, an experienced cyclist and service engineer, was preventable. She said: 'It is simply disgraceful that a pothole on such a busy road was allowed to go unrepaired. This should not have happened\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

But just months after winning a modelling contest that would take her overseas, the 12-year-old's lofty plans to make it to the runway hit a snag. Venessa was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer on January 5 after a nasty fall, which left her with pains in her leg. Aspiring model Venessa Harris, 12, was diagnosed with bone cancer just months after she won a talent search. Venessa is pictured with her proud mother, Karen Monaghan, and grandmother, Lyn Harris. At first doctors dismissed it as growing pains but shortly after discovered she had Ewing\u2019s sarcoma as her discomfort continued. Venessa's parents Kelly Harris and Karen Monaghan found out that their daughter could have cancer on Christmas Eve, but her condition wasn't confirmed until the new year. Mr Harris and Ms Monaghan spent Christmas at the family's Windorah home, in central west Queensland, with a dark cloud hanging over their head. 'It was really hard, extremely hard. We'd gone home Christmas Eve,' Ms Monaghan told Daily Mail Australia. The 12-year-old was the international winner in the Tamblyn\u00a0Young Model Discovery contest. Venessa, whose family live in Windorah, gained self-confidence from the competition after struggling with low self-esteem. Her family have been a constant support for Venessa who is currently undergoing chemotherapy in Brisbane. 'It was a very scary at that time. We were given clear instructions for her not to use her leg.' Then days later at Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in South Brisbane, a doctor told the family what they had feared after Venessa underwent medical scans. The cancer was located in the neck of Venessa's right femur and she was told it had eaten away so much of her bone that it had the thickness of an egg shell. 'The first few weeks were really chaotic and extremely stressful, as Kelly and I went through that uncontrollable fear stage,' Ms Monaghan said. The family's mood was in stark contrast to what it had been just months earlier, when Venessa was named international winner in the Tamblyn Young Model Discovery contest in September. Ms Monaghan said the contest had lifted Venessa's spirits and boosted her self esteem. 'She was feeling pretty down with her self-esteem.

Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting. That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees. 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued.

That's what happened to cyclist Wang Pingan as he neared the end of a two-wheel trek that covered thousands of miles through every major province in the vast country, according to local media. Arriving in the southern city of Shenzhen, in southern Guandong province, Wang locked up his trusty mountain bike, loaded with panniers, to check out electronics markets in the city's Huaqiangbei area. Within 10 minutes the thieves struck. But here's where the story takes an unexpected turn. Despite police initially saying odds were stacked against the bike ever being recovered, Shenzhen's finest managed to track it down and return it. The Southern Metro News reported that police apprehended an alleged criminal and sent Wang a photo of a bike they recovered. He recognized it instantly. They said the theft, from a road junction \"infested\" by cycle thieves was caught on surveillance cameras. The bike had likely been sold twice before being recovered. \"We don't want this lad visiting Shenzhen and having a bad memory of the city,\" a police spokesman told the paper. Now, with 29,200 kilometers under his tires, Wang can continue the final few days of his epic journey.

Nick Clegg said wealthy people with holiday homes would not mind having to 'chip in a bit' to protect services in areas where as many as one in 10 homes are vacant for much of the year. The well-off buying up homes in tourist hotspots has also driven up property values, leaving local people priced out of the areas where they grew up. Nick Clegg - steps off a fishing boat as he visits Newlyn Harbour, near Penzance, Cornwall today - said wealthy people with holiday homes would not mind having to 'chip in a bit' to protect services in areas where as many as one in 10 homes are vacant for much of the year. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg holds a cod at the Newlyn Fish Market in Cornwall this morning after unveiling his plan to save popular rural areas from the blight of second home owners. Under the Lib Dem plan, launched in Cornwall today, local authorities would have the power to charge 200 per cent council tax. The levy would be used in part to deter people from buying holiday homes in the first place, but the money generated could be used to support schools, post officers and other services which can become unviable without sufficient permanent residents. The double council tax would not be compulsory, but councils in areas like Cumbria, Cornwall and Devon have said they would be interested in the idea to 'discourage' second home ownership. On a campaign visit in St Austell, Cornwall, Mr Clegg said the move could help 'particularly in such a wonderful part of the country as this where there are so many people with second homes and where the prices because of that are way beyond the reach of many young people wanting to get their feet on the first rung of the property ladder'. The Lib Dem leader even claimed second home-owners would 'like to chip in a bit extra' to fund the communities in which they they spend their holidays. Mr Clegg, who visited Newlyn fish market and harbour with St Ives candidate Andrew George as he launched his countryside charter, told ITV News: 'It is giving councils the freedom to raise a bit of money from those who holiday in a community but don't live in a community all year round so that local public services can be properly supported for those people who do live in their community all year round.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)The VII Summit of the Americas was supposed to be all about the symbolic handshake between the United States and Cuba.  But insert Venezuela into the mix and Panama City, Panama, quickly turns into a \"triangle of tension.\" Heads of state from 35 countries in the Western Hemisphere have met every three years to discuss economic, social or political issues since the creation of the summit in 1994.  Cuba has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery, with some Latin American leaders threatening not to attend the Summit of the Americas if the United States and Canada didn't agree to invite President Raul Castro. The tide changed December 17, 2014, when President Barack Obama and Castro announced that more than five decades of Cold War rivalry was ending. Diplomats from both countries immediately began negotiations to establish embassies in Havana and Washington, and the attention immediately focused on the Summit of the Americas, where for the first time since the about-face, Obama and Castro would come face-to-face. The much anticipated handshake between Obama and Castro would steal all the headlines if it wasn't for Cuba's strongest ally, Venezuela. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro recently accused the United States of trying to topple his government and banned former President George Bush, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and Senators Bob Menendez and Marco Rubio from entering Venezuela. \"They can't enter Venezuela because they're terrorists,\"  Maduro said, blaming the American politicians for what he called terrorist actions in Iraq, Syria and Vietnam. The U.S. State Department said the allegations of U.S. involvement in a coup plot against Maduro were \"baseless and false.\" Later,  Obama issued an executive order sanctioning seven Venezuelan officials for human rights violations and saying the country was a \"threat to national security.\" White House officials said every executive order includes that language, but it has sparked a fiery response from Maduro, who has been collecting millions of signatures demanding the repeal of the order.  He also asked for repeal in full-page ads in The New York Times and in a Panama City newspaper. Maduro didn't stop there; he has been rallying other Latin American leaders, including Bolivian President Evo Morales, Ecuador's Rafael Correa and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega. But perhaps most damning for the United States -- and creating the \"triangle of tension\" at the summit --  Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez has sided publicly with Maduro. \"We reiterate our strong condemnation of the unacceptable and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions imposed against the sister nation of Venezuela and the continued foreign interference with the purpose\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility \"out of an abundance of caution\" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the CDC said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate outbreak in Texas, the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. \"Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,\" the CDC said. In early March, in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak, Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products, according to the CDC. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Known as much for his racy - often pornographic - photo shoots as he is for the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him. And this week he faced accusations from the model Kate Upton that he had released footage of her dancing in a bikini without her permission. Scroll down for video. In a new interview with Vogue Kate Upton has revealed that the photographer Terry Richardson released footage of her dancing in a bikini in a video called 'Cat Daddy' without her permission. In an excerpt from an interview Kate did with Vogue in June 2014, it was claimed that Kate was not happy with Terry for releasing the 'Cat Daddy' footage which has been viewed more than 22 million times. In the one-minute-long film, which played a huge part in Kate's rise to fame, and which was uploaded to YouTube two years ago, Kate is seen dancing seductively in a tiny red string bikini - the model says the film was not meant to be for public consumption. Alexa Chung writes in Vogue: 'Terry Richardson found himself on the receiving end of her wrath in May 2012, when he uploaded his now infamous video of Upton in a teeny-weeny bikini doing the Cat Daddy, a dance craze that appears to involve a lot of grinding, \"paws\" aloft. 'The video received millions of hits on YouTube - not to mention a number of slow-motion versions for the more discerning customer - but, at the time, Upton was horrified because the behind-the-scenes video had been filmed for fun, not something she expected would make the final cut.' Terry has worked with Miley Cyrus (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) shooting them in his New York studio. Terry sat front row at the Alexander Wang fashion show in September 2013 alongside Kanye West. When asked about the situation Kate said: 'I was like, \"That was disrespectful, you could have told me!''.' But Upton also adds that there's no bad blood over the YouTube video anymore. 'Now, obviously, it's fine.' However this is not the first time that the 49-year-old photographer who has shot everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kim Kardashian in his New York studio has faced controversy.

Mohammad Liaqat even assaulted the headmaster during the rampage in which he hurled insults at white teachers in front of shocked parents as they picked up their children. The 34-year-old objected to the strict uniform policy at Mount Carmel High School which stated that pupils could not have beards. Liaqat launched into a 'racist tirade' at white members of staff after 14-year-old boys were told they could not keep their facial hair, police said. After being arrested, Liaqat was told to stay away from the school, so went to another  school nearby where he continued his rant. When Jeff Brown, headmaster of St Oswald's Roman Catholic Primary School, asked him to move on, Liaqat shoulder barged him, Burnley Crown Court was told. He has a child at the secondary school in Accrington, Lancashire, but was not related to the two 14-year-olds who wanted to have facial hair for religious reasons. Liaqat launched his first outburst even though the situation involving the students\u2019 beards had already been resolved at Mount Carmel. During a three-day trial this week, Liaqat was found guilty of one count of assault and five counts of racially or religiously aggravated behaviour.

After the trial, Xavier Bowers, headteacher at Mount Carmel said: 'We are pleased that justice has been done in this instance.

Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'.

A video from a hearing in a court on Friday showed a San Diego police officer being hit with his own cruiser. William Bogard has pleaded not guilty after being charged with attempted murder, assault and vehicle theft. Officer Jeffrey Swett\u00a0testified on the stand that Bogard was smiling behind the wheel while running him down. The hearing was held so a judge could determine if there is substantial evidence for a trial. Swett testified on the witness stand that Bogard was smiling behind the wheel while running him down, according to ABC News. He said:\u00a0'I figured at that point in time he was going to kill me.' The officer added he felt \u00a0'immediate pain' upon impact and 'forcefully hit' the pavement afterwards. Bogard was able to get into Swett's car without resistance because the officer was investigating reports about the suspect breaking into a house and threatening to kill the occupants, according to\u00a010News. The suspect faces 19 years to life in prison if he is convicted and the preliminary hearing will resume on Monday. When the vehicle struck Swett, it was traveling\u00a0at a speed of 15 to 22 miles an hour, according to\u00a0deputy district attorney Michael Runyon.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Baggage handlers at Miami International Airport have been caught on video as they steal items from passenger luggage. The Miami-Dade Police Department set up a hidden camera to deal with the ongoing problem of luggage theft, and found workers rifling through checked bags both before they were loaded onto planes and once inside the aircraft's belly. This as it is revealed that airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014. Scroll down for video. Police also caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport (above) stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera. A baggage handler (above) at JFK Airport in New York was also caught on camera going through a passenger's wallet. CNN\u00a0reports that 31 employees have been arrested for theft in Miami since 2012, including six this year. Incidents of theft at that airport are far less however that New York's John F. Kennedy, which has more claims of lost property that anywhere else in the country. In 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera at that airport, and found workers stealing cash, jewelry, iPhones and iPads, which led to six arrests. Across the country in Los Angeles, 16 airport workers were fired last year after police obtained search warrants for their homes following a increase in reported thefts at the terminal where they were employed. 'We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,' said Patrick Gannon, the police chief at that airport. Overall, there have been 30,621 claims of missing valuables since 2010, with most of these coming from checked luggage. Of those claims, 2,493 occurred at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 (above a JFK employee) Most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal, with only Orlando and Miami screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only Miami screening them when they leave. Since 2002, the TSA has fired 513 workers for theft, though it is now known how many of them faced criminal charges. Gannon believes that theft is not the only problem either, as it could lead to bigger threats in the nation's airports. 'I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism.'\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}
{"instructions":"[INST] Article: (CNN)There are two paths to practicing medicine in America. There's the traditional, time-tested way, where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians. Then there's the approach being forged in Florida and Arizona: getting elected to a state legislature. Lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice. In 2011, Florida enacted the Firearm Owners' Privacy Act, which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety.  Guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk. Asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry. I treat brain injuries, and it's part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them, like driving. And handling weapons. Some of those I treat suffered their injuries by bullets, typically fired by family members or themselves. Does anyone really believe I shouldn't talk about gun safety in these cases? It's a good thing I don't practice in Florida. Florida's gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it, and while a three-judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer, doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th Circuit Court of Appeals decides whether it will take up the case, a decision that could come down any day, the president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Tommy Schechtman, told me. He is a plaintiff in the case. In Arizona, another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer. Bill 1318 goes a step beyond silencing doctors. It requires them to lie. The bill was originally a hum-drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services, a common state and federal strategy. But legislators slid in a last-minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill RU-486 tell patients the pill is reversible. That's the opinion of a particular San Diego doctor who says this can be done through risky, large doses of progesterone. But the doctor hasn't proven his case, and his regimen is not recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or the Food and Drug Administration. Any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the San Diego regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients, but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

Dr Mark Urban  studied data from 131 biodiversity studies to come to his bleak conclusions, which are published in the journal, Science. He proposes that the rate of extinction will speed up in line with rising temperatures. If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2 per cent. Researchers from the University of Connecticut warned  animals in regions where shrinking habitats and barriers to migration compound the problem are most at risk. Antarctica, which is home to many species of penguins (stock image) is one of these places. But if global warming maintains its current trajectory and a 4.3 degree increase, that could increase to 16 per cent, he said. 'If the world does not come together and control greenhouse gas emissions and we allow the Earth to warm considerably we will face a potential loss of one in six species,' Dr Urban told the BBC. 'Many species will be able to shift their ranges and keep up with climate change whereas others will not either because their habitat has disappeared or because they can't reach their habitat anymore.' If future temperatures increase by only two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, the extinction risk would increase from 2.8 to 5.2%.

But instead the paperwork was shelved by officials until it was discovered in 2013 and belatedly passed to Leicestershire Police.

Beck was jailed in 1991 for abusing children after a trial in which Janner was named by a victim, prompting him to proclaim his innocence in the Commons. The MP expected the 11 pages of detailed notes, which also identified several other suspects, to be passed to police. But nothing was done until it was uncovered during a review of Home Office archives in 2013. Labour MP Simon Danczuk is calling for the Home Office to 'come clean' over the dossier.

Concrete from a construction project crashed onto the family's car, killing Josh and Vanessa Ellis and their 8-month-old son, Hudson, authorities said. \"The damage was so severe it was impossible to tell how many victims were in the vehicle. The only thing we had was we could tell there was one victim,\" said Officer Todd Green of Bonney Lake Police Department, according to CNN affiliate KOMO. It took nine hours Monday for crews to remove enough debris to discover the death toll on Angeline Road underneath State Route 410, authorities said. Authorities continued their investigation Tuesday, but initial findings were that there was an ongoing construction project on the highway and a side jersey barrier \"came loose and fell onto the roadway,\" Green told the station. \"When it fell off the overpass, it landed square on the roof of the vehicle,\" Green added. Josh and Vanessa Ellis were youth pastors at the EastPointe Foursquare Church in Puyallup, near Bonney Lake, the church said. The couple earlier wrote a short autobiography on the church website: \"We love to laugh. We are passionate about seeing young people discover the love and grace that Jesus abundantly pours out on them. \"We get really excited about good coffee, quality time with friends and Seattle welcoming an NBA basketball team back to our city,\" the couple wrote. \"We love drive-in movies, frozen yogurt, dates to IKEA and trips to the beach.\" Lead Pastor James Ludlow said his church was reeling. \"We are stunned!

Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how \"flawed\" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases. CNN does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases, but in this instance, both parties have spoken publicly about their experience. They have also both said in separate interviews with The New York Times that Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing. Nungesser, an international student from Germany, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school; its president, Lee Bollinger; and the visual arts professor who oversaw Sulkowicz's mattress project, \"Carry That Weight,\" as part of her senior thesis. The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Nungesser's right to an education free of gender-based discrimination by allowing Sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing. During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a \"serial rapist\" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus. The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz \"transform her personal vendetta\" into a \"Columbia-sponsored calumny\" by supporting \"Carry That Weight\" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through \"this outrageous display of harassment and defamation.\" Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia. \"This is a person who is one of my students, and I care about all of my students.

This is important because males nest close together to one another and form singing choruses like frogs or toads to demonstrate their virility and strength.

Outage: Jean-Marie Le Pen angered his daughter when he said Nazi gas chambers were 'a detail of history' Anger: The 87-year-old has now said his Marine - the leader of the Front Nationale -'may want him dead' But, in response to suggestions he should step down from his position, Mr Le Pen told RTL radio it was a 'crazy idea'. Mr Le Pen explained: 'The prestige that I obviously still have within the National Front would cause a considerable stir, and a loss of influence for Marine that she probably doesn't gauge.' He added: 'Marine Le Pen may want me dead, that's possible, but she must not count on my co-operation.' In an interview on Wednesday, Mr Le Pen flamed allegations of anti-Semitism by praising the wartime leader Marshall Phillippe Petain, who collaborated with the Nazis. Mr Le Pen also said that France's Spanish-born Socialist Prime Minister was an 'immigrant' and so unfit to run the country. And he made it clear that he was 'nostalgic' for the days when Algeria, the biggest country in Africa, was French. Stubborn: However, Mr Le Pen has refused to step down as honorary president of the far right party. Ms Le Pen took over the National Front (FN) from her father in 2011, and has tried to purge it of its extremists. Furious with her father's latest outburst, his daughter said she would oppose his candidacy in December elections to lead the southeastern Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region. She said his'scorched earth strategy' of causing maximum public outrage amounted to 'political suicide'. 'The FN doesn't want to be held hostage to his vulgar provocations,' said Ms Le Pen, adding: 'His aim is to harm.'

Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, said judges and courtrooms should allow women to wear the traditional dress as they should'show, and be seen to show' respect towards different customs. He said judges should be'sensitive' to the fact that they usually came from'more privileged sector of society' than many of those facing them and they should have an understanding of the 'different cultural and social habits'. Lord Neuberger said Britain's privileged judges must be aware of their'subconscious bias' when dealing with poorer members of society. His address to the Criminal Justice Alliance came at a time of uncertainty over the place of Muslim traditional dress in the legal system. Following a controversial trial in 2003 of a Muslim woman accused of witness intimidation, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said there was a need for clear guidance on the issue. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. The 22-year-old was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court after changing her plea. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. Here she pictured during her court hearing. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights upheld a ban by France on wearing the Muslim full-face veil, the niqab. A case was brought by a 24-year-old French woman, who argued that the ban on wearing the veil in public violated her freedom of religion and expression. In Lord Neuberger's address, he said judges and lawyers often failed to recognise how 'artificial and intimidating' courts could be for ordinary people. He said: 'I sometimes wonder whether our trial procedures really are the best way of getting at the truth. 'Would you feel that you had given of your best if you had been forced to give evidence in unfamiliar surroundings, with lots of strangers watching, in an intimidating court, with lawyers in funny clothes asking questions, often aggressively and trying to catch you out, and with no ability to tell the story as you remember it?'

Her husband, Moreshwor, a cotton farmer, won't be around to see his children grown up. He committed suicide early in the pregnancy. Eight years back, Yogita's father-in-law, also a cotton farmer, took his own life. \"He was in so much debt,\" 25-year-old Yogita said of her late husband. \"He wasn't getting any money from cotton. He chose death over distress.\" It's a familiar story in families across Western India's cotton production belt, where, a cotton lobbyist group claims, one cotton farmer commits suicide every eight hours. \"We get reports of two to three farmer suicides every day,\" said Kishor Tiwari, leader of the farmers advocacy group, Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS). Vidarbha, in the eastern region of the state of Maharashtra, is known as the epicenter of the suicide crisis. According to VJAS data, some 2,900 farmers from the area have taken their lives since 2013; more than 500 have died since the start of this year. There are a number of reasons for the hopelessness among Vidarbha farmers. Unseasonal rain and hail destroyed many crops earlier this year. But they've also had to contend with the flipside: a plentiful harvest in 2014 drove prices down while production costs rose, leaving many farmers either lacking income or burdened with debt from loans taken out to help keep them afloat. Last year was a record year for cotton production, resulting in a glut of cotton on the world market. India produced 40 million bales of the fiber in 2013\/14 crop year, and is the second largest global cotton grower, after China. The record surplus of cotton in the global market pushed down prices hurting farmers, particularly in Vidarbha, which is becoming increasingly reliant on cotton. \"Our land mostly supports only two crops: cotton and soybean. But for the past few years, soybean yield has consistently been decreasing. So we mostly depend on cotton,\" said Murali Dhidkar, a local cotton farmer. He said in the past year, cotton prices had halved. \"I'm getting around 50 dollars per quintal. Just a year ago it was 100 dollars. I've never seen such a low price.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Tripoli, Libya (CNN)Smugglers lure Arab and African migrants by offering discounts to get onto overcrowded ships if people bring more potential passengers, a CNN investigation has revealed. A smuggler in the Libyan capital of Tripoli laid bare the system for loading boats with poor and desperate refugees, during a conversation that a CNN producer secretly filmed. The conversation, recorded using a mobile phone, exposes the prices and incentives used to gather as many migrants as possible onto ships. An estimated 1,600 migrants have died so far this year on the dangerous Mediterranean crossing, but still more wait to try to reach Europe. CNN's producer was introduced to a Senegalese and Malian smuggler by an intermediary in Tripoli, who mistakenly thought she was a Syrian looking to bring other Syrian refugees with her onto boats to Italy. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories. The smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of Tripoli near the city's many ports, where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready. The building could only be reached by walking down a trash-littered alleyway, and featured a series of packed rooms, separated by curtains, where dozens sat -- well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat. The smuggler explained that the \"final price\" for Syrians -- often thought to be richer than their African migrant counterparts -- was $1,000. He added that for each Syrian she brought with her, the producer would get a $100 discount. So if she brought 10, she could travel free. He explained how the \"discount\" was \"well known,\" suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat. Any fears about the crossing were supposed to be allayed by the smuggler insisting the boats they used had new motors, and that the Senegalese pilot would have a satellite telephone and GPS to assist the crossing. He also assured CNN's producer, when asked, that if the people became too many, they would use two boats.

A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments.

He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act.

A senior officer attended the hearing and said the law changed in 1996 that meant an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if it happened more than a year before.

Charity Bite-Back, which campaigns to protect sharks, reported the eatery after Jason Chan, its marketing manager, boasted that it sold the soup and another dish made with ground shark teeth. Scroll down for video. The revelations come after the Royal China Club, a restaurant in central London, was raided by inspectors after boasting of selling shark fin soup and another dish made from ground shark teeth. Charity workers say that restaurants are either disguising the soup (pictured) on their menus as 'fish fin soup', or are offering it to Mandarin speaking customers if they ask. More than 70 million sharks are killed each year for their fins, often dying slow, painful deaths after being dumped back into the sea once their most valuable parts have been cut off. Graham Buckingham, campaign director at Bite-Back, told The Times he was disappointed that The Royal China Club was not fined for their breach. He added: 'There's never any big penalty for this type of discovery and even if trading standards had chosen to prosecute, the fines are described as minimal.' Charity Bite-Back believes as many as one in five Chinese restaurants are selling the soup after exploiting a loophole which allows people to bring 20kg of fins into the country if they are for personal consumption.

John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain. His family feared the worst after discovering a note describing how much he missed his wife of 63 years and how he could not live without her. Double tragedy: John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, pictured together on their wedding anniversary, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain. Nottinghamshire Police launched an appeal in a bid to track down the grandfather-of-three on the day he disappeared from his home in St Ann's, Nottingham. Today officers confirmed a body pulled from the River Trent on April 15 by a specialist underwater search unit was sadly that of the missing pensioner. His family believe he may have killed himself at the picturesque beauty spot where the devoted couple enjoyed going for a walk. Message: Mr Lord's daughter Alison said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all' and described how he could not live without his wife. Mr Lord's last known moments were also captured on CCTV as he parked his white Toyota Yaris car near close to the Trent at 3.15am on April 6. The footage then shows the pensioner walking toward a bridge, which was the last sighting of him. His daughter, Alison Lord, 56, said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all.' Speaking before his death, the teaching assistant, who lives in Bulwell, Nottingham, added: 'He did leave a note. 'It said he couldn't live without June, and he apologised and said \"love to all\".

What\u2019s more, it now seems likely to remain that way. Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size, the council has ruled they can stay. It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of Mrs Alexander\u2019s family. It kicked off 35 years ago when Mrs Alexander\u2019s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii. A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge (pictured) has finally come to and end after 35 years. The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour's massive hedge. Then, 23 years ago, single mother Mrs Alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour Jeanette Robinson to trim the hedge. She claims Mrs Robinson refused and declared: \u2018I would rather move than touch these trees.\u2019 The dispute rumbled on, with Mrs Alexander, 54, claiming that the trees knocked \u00a320,000 off the value of her property. She sensed an opportunity, however, with the passing of the High Hedge Act in Scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases. Stirling Council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay, despite claims it has knocked \u00a320,000 off the value of neighbour Audrey Alexander's house (pictured) The situation came to a head in 2008, when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour's garden shed. Audrey Alexander (pictured) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches. But her council has ruled that Mrs Robinson can keep the hedge, although it has to be cut to 20ft. Mrs Alexander said the ruling made \u2018no difference\u2019. The High Hedge Act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden. Complainants and the hedge's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort. Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear, disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached. The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice, which orders owners to cut the hedge back, or decide not to act.\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}

'One-nil to the Arsenal' used to be commonplace before Arsene Wenger arrived and made everything more exciting, and you sensed the class of 2015 quite enjoyed travelling north and nicking the narrowest of victories at Burnley with a first-half goal from Aaron Ramsey. It was Arsenal's eighth win in a row, their best run since the Invincibles team in 2004, and kept the pressure on Chelsea, who they meet in their next league game at the Emirates. Only once before this season have Arsenal won 1-0 but striker Olivier Giroud feels the hard-fought victory proved there is more to this current Wenger team than pass-pass-pass and dissolve when the going gets tough. In other words, they are built to last. Olivier Giroud wants Arsenal to continue their Premier League winning streak and challenge for the title. 'You can't play your best football every game. We tried to be focused on not conceding and it's one more clean sheet,' Giroud said proudly. 'As long as we were winning the game I don't think we were in too much danger. We are really pleased. 'If we had been told we would win this game 1-0 I would have signed for it straight away. Burnley played really tough against us. It was a big fight. 'We know about the record of the Invincibles. It's really good for us to be near that and I'm really proud to take part. But we don't want to stop here. We want to carry on and keep this good run going until the end.'

Yet something as straightforward as a sporting handshake at a low-key draw ceremony, before representing Canada in a Fed Cup match at the weekend, seems to be beyond her. Her refusal to shake hands with Romanian opponent Alexandra Dulgheru turned out to be the precursor of a dreadful few days for the world no 7.

Bouchard refused to shake the hand of\u00a0Alexandra Dulgheru before\u00a0Fed Cup match at the weekend. Bouchard ended up suffering not just the humiliation of losing to far lesser ranked opponents in front of her hometown crowd in Montreal, but of being mocked by the opposing Romanian team after they had inflicted defeat. Moreover, having previously been able to do little wrong in the eyes of her compatriots, she brought upon herself the scorn of fair-minded Canadians in the media, social and otherwise. Even Romania\u2019s world number three Simona Halep, a shy and retiring type, weighed in by casting aspersions about the kind of upbringing Bouchard has had. Bouchard explained away her graceless act as merely being true to herself, but the truth is that such brattish behaviour is neither principled nor smart. She would be well-advised to avoid this sort of bravado until she starts winning again. It is not the first time that Bouchard has declined the traditional shake of hands that takes place at the draw prior to matches in the Fed Cup, the women\u2019s incomprehensible equivalent of the Davis Cup.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Manchester City wanted Isco when he left Malaga two years ago but he chose Real Madrid over Manuel Pellegrini. It was a tough decision coming after his admission that the coach he had worked with on the Costa del Sol was like a footballing father to him. Judging from comments made after Real\u2019s midweek win over Atletico Madrid, he still harbours some regrets over that decision to not follow the manager who really gave him his big chance. Pellegrini allowed him to star in the Champions League campaign that took Malaga all the way to the quarter-finals, where they felt only refereeing incompetence prevented them reaching the semis. \u2018I am not very content, I thought I was playing well,\u2019 was his message to Spanish television on Wednesday night after the win over Atletico. It was strange sentiment to convey with so much positivity around the club after their safe passage to the semi-finals. Spanish midfielder Isco is unhappy with his current role and playing time at Real Madrid. Isco rarely starts for Real Madrid when all of Carlo Ancelotti's main options are fit. He later tweeted: 'If we all stick together we will go further.' The show of solidarity was an attempt to gloss over the gut reaction after the match that revealed his sense of injustice at always being the player who sits out when everyone else is fit. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s first choice front three is Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema and his preferred midfield is Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez. Isco is the seventh man in that front six. And if Ancelotti persists with Sergio Ramos in midfield in Modric\u2019s absence, Isco could even sit back on the bench when Bale returns. If Pellegrini stays at City and Isco remains unhappy about how he only fits in at Real Madrid when there are injuries, the Premier League could appear on his horizon again. Isco joined Real Madrid from another La Liga side Malaga in the summer of 2013. The 23-year-old had a choice of Real Madrid or Manchester City, and chose the Spanish giants. It would be too much to ask him to fill Yaya Toure\u2019s boots. Toure's great strength is the way that huge stride of his takes him up and down the pitch so quickly.

Amanda Butler, 42, had enjoyed a totally normal pregnancy until her waters broke at 25 weeks. Her son Callum was born weighing just 1lb 9oz and with translucent skin - and both she and doctors feared he would not survive. In the weeks and months that followed, he underwent heart surgery, a lumbar puncture, laser eye surgery and 10 blood transfusions. Mrs Butler, a marketing consultant from Milton Keynes, later discovered her premature labour had been triggered by a common infection called bacterial vaginosis (BV). Scroll down for video. Callum Butler was born at just 25 weeks into his mother's pregnancy. His mother Amanda was later told an infection she had, called bacterial vaginosis, was to blame. The condition can also cause miscarriage. BV affects one in three women, making it twice as common as thrush. It occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted, leading to an unpleasant odour. If untreated, it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely. One of the biggest problems is that BV often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment, such as thrush. Misdiagnosis often occurs as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums because while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their GP, research has shown. Many other women, such as Mrs Butler, have simply never heard of the condition. She said: 'I was angry when I found out that BV had caused Callum\u2019s premature birth because it was the first I had heard of it. 'No-one ever told me the condition could lead to complications like this. 'It wasn't in any of the pregnancy books and was certainly never mentioned by midwives or doctors prior to it happening.'

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: A virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the Midwest and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in Iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the state's egg-laying chickens. Poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest Iowa's Osceola County - prompting a massive bird cull. Bird flu: Chickens stand in their cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa. Discovery of the bird flu on an Iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation's top egg-producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the U.S. with its breakfast staple. The confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country. Seven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the virus, dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since March. The virulent strain in question is the H5N2, a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. Yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply. So far, only two egg operations have been hit \u2014 the one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all the other cases in the Midwest have been at commercial turkey farms. Minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit, far more than any other state. Turkey farm: In this photo provided by Bethany Hahn is a flock of turkeys at a Minnesota poultry farm. The country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Precautions: Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu. Officials say that's because Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia.

But back in the early 21st century, taking a picture was an entirely different process, requiring patience, precision and a very talented eye.

A collection of pictures of Christina O'Gorman posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman, back in 1913 have been revealed as some of the earliest colour photographs ever taken. The ethereal images were taken on the beach at Lulworth Cove, Dorset, when Malcolm was 42. The images are part of the Royal Photographic Society, held at the National Media Museum, and are currently on display at the National Media Museum, Bradford. They are among a collection of the world's oldest surviving photographs. The woman in question was teenager Christina O'Gorman, posing for her father, electrical engineer and photographer Mervyn O'Gorman back in 1913. Mervyn was 42 at the time when he took the images of his daughter, who languidly sits, in an array of vibrant red outfits, including a swimsuit, a cloak and a shirt. The teen, characterised by her long strawberry-blonde hair, poses in different scenarios on the beach at Lulworth Cove in the English county of Dorset and appears unaware of her father. The delicately-coloured images are on display at the National Media Museum in Bradford. Christina is seen sitting on the Dorset beach with friends in the 102-year-old images. The strawberry-blonde teenager wore red, probably at the request of her father as the vibrant colour captured particularly well via the autochrome process. Mervyn was known as an early pioneer of colour photography and used the autochrome process to capture the haunting images. Patented in 1903, the process involved using glass plates covered in potato starches grains to filter pictures with dye.

Maria Malone-Guerbaa, 41, from London, used nothing but paints to turn herself into an uncanny painting of a grey rabbit with blue eyes, wearing a red bow tie. The mother-of-two said she didn't use any prosthetics or special effects to achieve the amazing result. Scroll down for video. Make-up artist Maria Malone-Guerbaa (left) just used paints to transform herself into a bunny. The final result took three hours to achieve after Maria simply googled pictures of bunnies, picking one she liked best and replicating the image on her face. She used her own brushes and kryolan paint, special dense, long-lasting make-up used by professionals working with stage actors. Maria began her project by painting a white base layer to create the shape of the rabbit's face and ears, adding the animal's eyes (below her own) and nose and mouth (over her own). The sides of her face and forehead was then painted with black paint, to form the bunny's entire head. With grey paint, black dots stippled over the top and finally details like whiskers, and the bow tie that is drawn from Maria's neck up to her chin, the look was complete. Maria explained her inspiration for her rabbit scheme: 'My last couple of projects have been animal-themed so, with Easter coming up, it had to be a rabbit this time around. 'It takes me about three hours in total and I'll stop every 20 minutes or so to take a picture of my progress. 'I just went on my iPhone and searched for rabbits on Google Images. You get so many then that you can just form your own picture.' The final result has earned thousands of likes on Instagram, along with her other posts showing how she transformed her face into Jack Nicholson from The Shining, Stevie Wonder, a cougar and Freddie Mercury. Maria used only her brushes and professional kryolan paints to create bunny ears, bright eyes and a nose. She captioned the picture: 'I've got #hare in my face!'

A popular  graduate fell to his death from a bedroom window in the Swiss Alps after playing drinking games, an inquest heard. Jake Shaw was just beginning his gap year - volunteering as a climbing instructor at Kandersteg International Scout Centre\u00a0- when the tragedy occurred last year. The 21-year-old had fallen\u00a025ft (8m) from the upper floor of the building in the early hours of August 1. He was airlifted to hospital in Bern suffering severe injuries but died nine days later. Lincoln Coroner's Court heard that shortly before his death, Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire.' After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at the centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a'very drunk state'. It is then believed he lost his balance as he tried to open a bedroom window and toppled out of the window at the adventure camp in Interlaken, Switzerland. Today Lincolnshire Central assistant coroner Paul Smith, concluded that Jake's death was an accident. He said: 'The level of alcohol in his body was consistent with 11 standard drinks. 'It's the presumption that he was undeniably very drunk that evening - how that affected his balance is a matter of speculation. 'The most likely explanation is that in his state he took himself to bed, opened the window and perhaps overbalanced and fell.\u00a0'I'm satisfied that this was a tragic accident.' The court heard how in the game 'Power Hour', participants have to drink a shot of beer every minute for an hour and if completed two and a half litres of beer is consumed. A police report read out during the inquest, added: 'Examinations indicated that the August 1 celebrations were followed by a private party which Jake had attended. 'There were group games with drinks in the staff room. Jake had probably drank a large amount of mainly beer. After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at Kandersteg International Scout Centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a'very drunk state'.

Seven of Slager's fellow cops responded to his call forback-up after the shooting - as handcuffed Walter Scott lay dead or dying with five bullet wounds to the back. But the fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting given to the media, or in the force's incident report filed after the shooting.

'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.'

'The odor and ammonia fumes in the home caused me to have to leave the residence to catch my breath and regain balance as I was becoming light headed,' he added.

After starring in Everton's midfield and making his England debut, Jack Rodwell was being linked with every big club around. Sir Alex Ferguson was known to be an admirer but Rodwell was snapped up by Manchester City for \u00a312million. Repeated injury problems and the presence of Yaya Toure, David Silva, Samir Nasri and Javi Garcia saw his appearances limited, while Fernandinho arrived for \u00a330m the next summer.

Bold statement: Christien Sechrist (pictured) has a large tattoo of his son's portrait on his own face. The detailed portrait of the trainee electrician's son Perseus, which features his chubby cheeks and big eyes, takes up the entire left side of Christien's face, starting at the corner of his eyebrow and ending down by his chin. There is even some additional detail featured on his ear lobe. When he shared a picture of his new ink on his Facebook page last summer, Christien gave a shout out to the tattoo artist who designed the creation by thanking him for accurately rendering his son's image. 'Thanks Cody Gibbs for doing awesome work on me. Looks just like my son,' he wrote. But Christien soon found himself being berated by his friend Ashlee Nicole who asked if the picture was a joke. After Christien confirmed that it wasn't, Ashlee expressed her frustration with his choice of location for the tattoo, noting that the ink would likely make it difficult for the young father to get a job in the future. 'Why on your f****** face?! How are you ever going to get a real f***** job to support your son with a tattoo on your face?' she asked. Doting dad: The 20-year-old, from Houston, Texas (thought to be pictured with his son Perseus), insists that he has no regrets about his distinctive facial ink, and claims that his young son 'loves it' Snap a selfie: Christien has eagerly defended his facial ink to his friends on Facebook, many of whom questioned why he chose to get the tattoo in such an obvious location.

A manhunt has been launched after a father-of-two described as friendly and chatty was shot dead outside a takeaway in a professional-style hit. Tipu Sultan was gunned down shortly before 10pm last night at the back of the Herbs n Spice takeaway that he ran in South Shields. Emergency services found Mr Sultan, who lived in Sunderland, but was originally from Bangladesh with a gunshot wound and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Witnesses report seeing two men wearing crash helmets and dressed in dark clothing on a motorbike  driving away from the area in the direction of Lizard Lane immediately after the shooting. Today there is a heavy police presence on Lake Avenue in South Shields with the lane behind the takeaway completely taped off with officers believing Mr Sultan, 32, was targeted deliberately. South Tyneside Superintendent Sav Patsalos said: 'The investigation into the murder of Tipu Sultan is in its very early stages and we are appealing for anyone with any information that could help us with our inquiries to contact us as soon as possible. 'We are trying to establish the motive behind the incident and a full murder investigation is currently being carried out. 'We believe that this has been an isolated incident and not a random shooting, enquiries are ongoing to establish this. 'Those responsible may have planned the incident in advance of carrying it out and if anyone has seen anything or anyone suspicious in the area at anytime in the past few days then I'd ask them to come forward and speak to us. 'There is nothing to suggest there that is any risk to any other members of the public or any of the communities in South Tyneside and we understand this incident is extremely concerning for local people and that is why we have extra officers down in the Lake Avenue to reassure and speak to the public.

{"instructions":"[INST] Article: Inter owner Erick Thohir had warned both sets of players before the game that the 'eyes of the world' would be fixed on the 214th Derby della Madonnina. By the end of the first half, the gaze had probably focused elsewhere. While a rivalry like this one can capture the imagination of a city - and there is no doubting by the build up that Milan had been hit by derby fever - it takes a concoction of quality, intensity and passion to hold the attention of the average neutral. Not all elements were present at the San Siro. A goalless first half had produced the odd burst of quality, but little intensity. A goalless second provided little more. Former Chelsea defender Alex sees his attempt blocked by Inter keeper Samir Handanovic, in one of the game's few clear-cut chances. Philippe Mexes thought he had scored an own goal, as did his keeper Diego Lopez, but it was ruled out and the game remained goalless. Suso steps away from Inter forward Rodrigo Palacio as both sides showed endeavour, but very little quality. Suso jumps for the ball as Juan Jesus watches on, as the two sides struggled to create clear chances. Inter: Handonvic, Jesus, Vidic, Ranocchia, D'Ambrosio, Kovacic (Shaqiri 77), Medel, Gnoukouri (Obi 67), Hernanes, Palacio, Icardi. Booked: Jesus, Medel, D'Ambrosio, Hernanes.

There was plenty of passion on show, but that was largely displayed by both sets of supporters. That both sides are struggling was obvious from the pre-match build up. The painstaking effort put into pre-match choreographies of both Inter's Curva Nord and Milan's Curva Sud emphasised that this was no ordinary derby. There was much riding on it. This was their season in a nutshell. And so it proved on the pitch.

More than three years ago Claire, Emily, Christine and Lily Vincenti were taken from their Italian home by their mother, which sparked an ugly dispute that included claims of kidnapping. Their mother, Laura Garrett, had Australian passports made for the girls and fled to Australia. She claimed she had to escape her abusive partner, Tomasso Vincenti. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Flashback to 2012:\u00a0These were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart when four young sisters were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's Sunshine Coast home in the middle of the night and forced onto a plan back to their father in Italy. The sisters were returned to Italy in 2012, after Ms Garrett's story fell apart. The two eldest children,\u00a0Claire and Emily, told 60 Minutes' Tara Brown they had moved on from the ordeal. 'I think they were thinking more about themselves than us, you know, because we were put at the centre of this whole situation, and I don't know, they were a little bit selfish,' Claire Vincenti said. 'Because you know, we went through all of this \u2014 I mean, they did as well, but it was most hard for us than them, because they're the adults.' 'If I think about it now, maybe I've said stuff that I exaggerated a little bit, and that was just because I was liking my life in Australia and that was just because I didn't want to leave.' The four Vincenti sisters, including the two older girls Emil and Claire, had a'monster' of a father who abused them and their mother,or so the story went after the girls were removed from their home in dramatic circumstances and return to Italy.

Warnock was driving through a canyon in Lewiston, Idaho, on Wednesday when he saw the tree, then looked up to see an SUV dangling over the edge of a cliff.

Warnock dashed from his car and scrambled up a hill to the Yukon and its driver, 23-year-old Matthew Sitko, who appeared to be in shock. \"I got up there and I was like, 'Are you alright man?' He shook his head, yeah. I grabbed my Snap-on multi-tool and it had jagged edges on each end. I hit the window three times and it didn't break. Every time I hit it, the thing rocked like it was going to fall off,\" Warnock told KXLY. Sitko was finally able to get the passenger-side window down. Warnock then reached in and pulled Sitko out to safety -- a moment recorded by Kough's camera. Then Warnock disappeared. \"I left and got out of there before anyone knew who I was,\" he said.

Former Hearts star Templeton claimed last week that McCall had introduced a brand of coaching and tactical preparation which had been lacking under the previous management. But McCall, who is busy transforming the club on the pitch after three successive wins in the Championship, was less than impressed by the player's comments and hinted that they may have been motivated by the player's lack of game time under McCoist and McDowall. Rangers winger David Templeton spoke out about his former managers Ally McCoist and Kenny McDowall. 'David made an error,' said the ex-Rangers midfielder. 'He was out of the frame a wee bit under Kenny and Ally. 'But he knows we are not here to criticise what went on before, because the players were part of that.

The Light Blues captain put his elbow into the face of Jambos striker Osman Sow as the pair jumped for a high ball. McCall, whose team clung on for a vital 2-1 win after playing 50 minutes a man down, had been happy with McCulloch's displays until that point.

Whether it be Duncan Fletcher, David Lloyd, whoever, someone always seems to pay the price for our abject failure to compete on the global one-day stage. Paul Downton is just the latest victim. It is high time that we looked at the entire structure of English cricket and the reasons we are incapable of producing the types of cricketer required to succeed in international one-day cricket. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board. Moores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference. The system is broken and it desperately needs fixing if England are ever going to compete in limited-overs cricket again. Make no mistake, sacking Paul Downton does not mean some magic wand has been waved and all will be well. There are deep systemic problems. Too many of the current selectors and coaches are from the old guard and have failed to keep pace with the dramatic changes that have occurred in one-day cricket in recent years. From Downton to coach Peter Moores, to selectors James Whitaker and Angus Fraser, these are players from a different era who have been painfully slow to react to situations. Downton (left) and Peter Moores (right) pose during a press conference at Lord's Cricket Ground. Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup. Even the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain was a slow and protracted affair. They should have acted sooner. Like so much of English sport, our cricket system seems afraid of the maverick player and that has to change. In my view there is still too much bad blood around for Kevin Pietersen to return, with the fall-out from the book causing untold damage to so many relationships that it just seems inconceivable for him to return. Nasser Hussain believes the sacking of Cook as one-day captain was a slow and protracted affair. I hate it when things become about one individual and believe me, everything that has gone wrong with English cricket has not been down to the handling of Kevin Pietersen; however badly that has been done. But what is does highlight is the continued fear of the maverick player. From David Gower to Kevin Pietersen, English cricket has shown distrust for anyone who does not conform or fit into a safe stereotype\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}
{"instructions":"[INST] Article: A New York college has provoked anger after postponing its screening of movie American Sniper in response to complaints from Muslim students. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film. Bradley Cooper in his Oscar Nominated role as Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in US military history. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (pictured) in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. The film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students. However they appear to have done just the opposite. Following complaints from the RPI\u2019s Muslim Students\u2019 Association a number of students have said the postponement was an act of censorship and an attack on free speech, Fox News reported. While the film grossed a total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. A statement from the university explained the aim of the screening, coupled with the now scheduled educational forum, was to allow students in the campus community to \u2018participate in an intellectual discourse about the film and current world events\u2019. American Sniper, a film by Clint Eastwood about US Navy Seal sharp-shooter Chris Kyle the most deadly sniper in US history, has courted controversy since it was first shown in the US in November. While the film grossed an international total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. It was also accused of stoking racial hatred after screenings of the film led to a rise in threats against Americans of Middle Eastern origin and even some attacks on Muslims outside movie theaters. Earlier this month the University of Michigan flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus. The college pulled a screening over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school released statement saying the decision to cancel had not been consistent with the high value it placed on freedom of expression. Navy Seal and Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, depicted in the film, was killed at a shooting range in Texas. The school's vice president for student life, E. Royster Harper, acknowledged that it was \u2018a mistake\u2019 to call off the screening. \u2018The movie will be\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}
{"instructions":"[INST] Article: 'You're getting the hang of this commentary lark,' cooed Martin Tyler during Sky Sports coverage of the Manchester derby. Tyler was, of course, one half of the commentary team that was once seen as being the best of the bunch. That other half back then being his old partner Andy Gray. Nowadays, the man in the gantry alongside him is Gary Neville. And it was his zinger after United's fourth goal \u2013\u00a0'Smalling has scored. It's a mauling for City' \u2013\u00a0that got the veteran lip mic man reaching for the platitudes. And perhaps cementing the new best partnership in the process? I'm not sure if Neville actually carries his recently won Royal Television Society Pundit of the Year award around with him? He could probably just about squeeze the perspex trophy into his inside jacket pocket if he really fancied it, but I doubt he would because I think one thing you could never accuse Neville of being is one of the extroverts among the current batch of experts. Gary Neville  in the Sky Sports studio after co-commentating with Martin Tyler for the Manchester derby. Chris Smalling is pictured scoring for Manchester United as City goalkeeper Joe Hart sees it go in. United defender Smalling was an unlikely goalscorer against City and Neville had a zinger to match it. Co-commentator Neville analysed the goal by saying: 'Smalling has scored. It's a mauling for City' Nevertheless, on his return to his old stamping ground with that new title attached, it was good to see him to turn it on even just a bit. And put in a performance that fitted both his newly anointed status and the magnitude of the occasion. Neville was all over this thrilling derby right from the get go. 'We've got a proper game of football here,' he extolled early on, almost licking his lips at the prospect. He was also quick to point out what he saw as the 'graveyard' of City's right-hand side as United punished them time and time again along the hosts' attacking left. The razor-edged corner of tongue was saved not exclusively, but certainly frequently for Yaya Toure's performance. Time and time again Gary found himself talking about the various patches of grass in which he felt Yaya should be but very rarely was. And when co-commentator Tyler did observe that he could see Toure finally picking up his man, Neville snorted his retort. 'That's nice of him.'\n\nSummarize the above article in 3 sentences.\n [\/INST]"}
